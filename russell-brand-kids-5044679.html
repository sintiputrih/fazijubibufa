The English born actor landed on the map with his roles in late 2000s films including Get Him to the Greek, Arthur, and Forgetting Sarah Marshall.&nbsp;But what really gave him staying power in the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>public consciousness</a> was his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>passionate romance</a> and one year <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>marriage</a> to “Fireworks” singer <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Katy Perry.&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Obviously, the relationship didn’t work out, and after their 2011 split, Russell <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>eventually moved on</a> with former restaurateur <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Laura Gallacher</strong></a>. They’ve <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>been married</a> since 2017, and they’ve had two children together, both daughters. So who are Peggy and Mabel Brand? Learn all about the kids in the comedian’s life below.</p><h2>Mabel Brand</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>Mabel Brand</strong> was born to her Scottish blogger mom and actor dad in November of 2016, and according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News </a>at the time, he made the announcement during a stand-up show at Nottingham Playhouse. An audience member told the outlet, “He said he had to get home quickly because his girlfriend just had a baby.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Though Russell and Laura keep Mabel mostly out of the public eye, we do know she is now thriving at six years old. The comedian strategically shares updates on his life as a dad with his 3.1 million followers on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. In a March 1, 2023 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>post</a>, he shared a photo of a sweet children’s drawing. “When you are supposed to be looking at tour notes and your daughters give you art,” he captioned the pic.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>He also once said that he preferred not to “impose” a gender on Mabel. “I may not even impose a gender upon it, let the child be whatever the hell it is,” he said, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The U.K. Sun</a>.</p><h2>Peggy Brand</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Roughly two years later, in July of 2018, Russell and Laura quietly welcomed their second daughter, <strong>Peggy Brand</strong>. “Obviously they are over the moon, and Russell will no doubt be gushing about her whenever he next performs stand-up,” a source reportedly said, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The U.K. Sun</a>.&nbsp;“But they did not want to make a big announcement.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Little Peggy is now four years old. Russell spoke out about being a father during an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ITV News (via E! Online)&nbsp;</a>back in 2017. “I think it’s to have something outside of yourself that’s more important than you, other than West Ham United,” he joked, before adding that being a dad is “the most wonderful thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9GuqqydnKF6o77Ap5tmo5mZwG6Bj21rb29pZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lenovo-readies-thinkbook-laptops.html><span>←</span><span>Lenovo Readies New ThinkBook Family of Laptops</span></a>
