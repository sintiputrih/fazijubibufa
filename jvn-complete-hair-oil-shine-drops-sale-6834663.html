This has been my experience, at least, ever since I started to dabble in the world of oiling. For context, my hair is far from thick. It does, however, splay into a strange, bottom-heavy triangle when it grows (partly because I fail to maintain a proper trimming schedule; partly because my ends are exceptionally parched and broken). I’m no stranger to flyaways and frizz, either, both of which frustrate me anytime I’m going for a glassy hair look.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Naturally, I’ve played with silicone-spiked hair oils, with the promises of speedy sleekness luring me in. But so far, there’s one product that actually gives me that glossy, slicked-back look, sans grease: the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">JVN Complete Oil Nourishing Drops</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After years of eschewing hair oil, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">JVN’s oil drops</a> have rekindled my interest in the category. Unlike silicone-based hair oils and serums, which enrobe hair in a heavy film to create a semblance of smoothness, JVN’s drops are silicone-free, oil-free, and positively lightweight — which should come as no surprise, considering its creator, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jonathan Van Ness</a>, has idyllic silky locks that most of us can only dream of. The drops are devoid of any ingredients that could leave a film post-shampoo — no need to double, triple, or quadruple shampoo, as I have on many occasions after using other hair-smoothing topicals.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>JVN</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$18 (Originally $24); <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">jvnhair.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I’ve used the shine drops a few times now — always overzealously to indulge in its scent, which I’d liken to “expensive salon smell.” (The actual notes: sparkling grapefruit, tangerine, violet, and florals.) Most importantly, I’ve yet to land myself in a puddle of oiliness, and I’m not alone. As one shopper noted, “it helps my hair look and feel so soft and shiny without weighing it down or feeling greasy.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite its silicone-free nature, this serum effectively tames flyaways and softens my ends. These effects are immediate, and my hair looks and feels softer within moments. The serum also lends a luminosity factor that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>one of my colleagues likened to makeup-like highlighter</a> for their hair. I concur, and so does another shopper, who says her hair “make[s] the whole place shimmer” when she walks into a room. If you’re intrigued, consider stocking up now: Until December 4, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">JVN Complete Nourishing Shine Drops</a> are 25 percent off.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to instant gratification, the serum imparts longer-lasting benefits, too. For one, it provides UV protection (this is particularly beneficial for color-treated hair, which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">can fade prematurely in excess sun exposure</a>). Secondly, it softens hair over time, thanks to a blend of high-quality, plant-based ingredients:: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Hemisqualane</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>squalane</a>, for instance, hibiscus extract, and meadowfoam, which together soften, protect, and nourish hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re wondering whether these drops will work with your particular hair type, rest assured: In true JVN fashion, this formula is created for everyone. Shopper sentiment validates this notion: “My natural curly hair is shiny and soft,” says one shopper, who calls the product a&nbsp; “Game changer.” Another reviewer, who has thin, bleached hair, says “[I] love the lightness of the oil, how it smooths my bleached hair.” As for me and my once-frazzled ends? Let’s just say I can push my overdue trim a little longer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shop the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">JVN Complete Oil Nourishing Drops</a> while they’re still on sale for a few more days.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shop-more-of-the-best-cyber-week-deals></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shop More of the Best Cyber Week Deals:</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57ya%2BlZpufor2tsdOeZKGZmad6sLXLZqqhoZ6aeqW%2BzqmqZquRobJugpdsa29uYw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./country-singer-luke-bell-dead-at-age-32-details.html><span>←</span><span>Country Singer Luke Bell Dead at Age 32: Details</span></a>
