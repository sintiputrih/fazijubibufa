Looking as sharp and fashion-forward as ever, the actress wore a waist-cinching all-black ensemble which consisted of cigarette pants with a sleeveless turtleneck and peep-toe heels. Timeless.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/db1fd7f513fa-bguk2896252001.jpg><p id=euE6CPUnQe data-wc=37>Although her laid-back LA look has gained her many fashion accolades, she occasionally goes all out and glitzy, and the star didn't disappoint as she totally lit up the red carpet at the <a class=hm-link href=#>SAG awards in February</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b3b6737c8720-gettyimages-2036465819.jpg><p id=eunK0iZI4U2- data-wc=71>Onlookers couldn't believe their eyes as she rocked a truly dazzling chainmail-style silver Celine floor-length gown. The strappy style showed off her perfectly honed physique and we are still obsessed with the Hollywood glam plunging neckline and sassy thigh-high split. The dress featured a light train with black lining and positively glistened as she sashayed past a sea of photographers. It's easy to see why many called her <a class=hm-link href=#>best-dressed that night</a>.</p><p id=eb984VzPl1 data-wc=66>Although she is known for her style, Jen isn't a fan of fashion shows. She once famously said: "I will never go to a fashion show again. I just find it all so… I don’t know… what is everybody doing here but judging and staring at each other. I can’t find the fabulousness in it. It’s all about what you look like.
