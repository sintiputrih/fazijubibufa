And then there were incidents that were happening at our church and at other churches where we felt like the people in power weren’t being held accountable for being terrible human beings,” said Director <strong>Adamma Ebo</strong> in an interview with IndieWire.</p><p>“We wanted to find a balance of questioning and critiquing this institution, and still celebrating it, because it’s so important to Black culture, but it could be doing better in a lot of ways.”</p><p>Adapted from their 2018 short film of the same name, the megachurch mockumentary marks writer-director Adamma Ebo and producer <strong>Adanne Ebo</strong>‘s feature film debut.</p><p>“I just think it’s important to support, nurture, and work with talented people,” said Regina Hall in an <a href=#>interview with Global Grind</a>.</p><p>“If they’re new, they’re new… but they’ve been working. They be new to us but it’s not like this is their first time. I don’t think of films as big or small. I know that is budget, but what does it allow you to play?”</p><p>Sterling jumped in, adding, What are the stories that I want to tell? What do I think needs to go out in the world? We’re in a place too where we’re blessed enough that, it’s not like I have to make so much money a year in order to pick these choices. I love this story. These filmmakers have something to say. Let me support this in the best way I know how to, in front of the camera and behind it.”</p><p>Honk for Jesus is produced by Monkeypaw’s <a href=#><strong>Jordan Peele </strong></a>and produced by <a href=#><strong>Daniel Kaluuya</strong></a> through his production company 59% with Amandla Crichlow; alongside Adamma Ebo, Adanne Ebo; Pinky Promise’s <strong>Jessamine Burgum</strong> and <strong>Matthew Cooper</strong>; <strong>Rowan Riley</strong>; <strong>Kara Durrett</strong>; and Regina Hall and Sterling K.
