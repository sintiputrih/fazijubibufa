[Verse 1]
Rattlesnake said to the copperhead
"You give us vipers a real bad name"
You prey on the weakest, fight for no reason
No wonder we get blamed"
Copperhead laughed, said, "Kiss my ass!
You can bark but there ain't much bite
You rattle that tail, but it's fear I smell
I think you're shaking out of fright"[Chorus]
Rattlesnake, copperhead
Either one of them'll kill you dead
We stay hungry, they get fed</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ben Briscoe Obituary: What Happened To Dublin Mayor? Death Cause Details</h2><time>Apr 20, 2024</time>
