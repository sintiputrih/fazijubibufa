This year, each of the anchors dressed up as a famous dancer (a very loose term) and performed that person’s famous dance, the full versions of which are on Today. The costumes themselves are actually decent, unlike when they all dressed up as Peanuts characters and ruined millions of childhoods.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Viola Davis Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</h2><time>Aug 30, 2024</time>
