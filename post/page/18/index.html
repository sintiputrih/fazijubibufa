ASUS N53JF: Four Times Lucky?
We’ve had a decent run of midrange laptop reviews of late; our favorite for overall features remains the Dell XPS 15 L501x, but there’s a catch: you really want the upgraded 1080p LCD, which it just so happens is now missing from Dell’s online configurator. We saw the RGB LED backlit panel on the old Studio XPS 16 come and go over time, so hopefully the LCD upgrade will make a return to the XPS 15, but without that panel the view of the 15.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>So next will we get an R/S/E remake?</h2><time>Sep 9, 2024</time>

The company has been more aggressive about display technologies and features since embarking on their Freesync project, and that is reflected in some of the changes made here.
Custom Resolution Support First and foremost, AMD has finally (and at long last) implemented support for custom resolutions within their control panel. Custom resolution support is something of a niche feature – most users will never find it, let alone need it – however it’s extremely useful for those users who do need it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Why Fans Think Max And Ruby Is So Much Darker Than It Appears</h2><time>Sep 9, 2024</time>

After Mark Wahlberg rose to fame after the release of his hit song “Good Vibrations” became wildly popular, a lot of people expected him to be a one-hit wonder who would soon be forgotten. While Wahlberg never released another song that took the world by storm, there is no doubt that he is far from forgotten. Even though it could easily be argued that Mark Wahlberg is luckier than most movie stars given that he overcame his potential one-hit-wonder status, things haven’t worked out perfectly for him.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/17/>← Prev Page</a>
