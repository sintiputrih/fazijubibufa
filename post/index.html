<a href=../asus-introduces-arez-brand-for-radeon-cards-as-amd-discusses-new-consumerfriendly-aib-branding.html></a>
This week, ASUS introduced new “AREZ” branding for their AMD Radeon video cards. This announcement comes in conjunction with an AMD ‘freedom of choice’ initiative for consumers and gamers. Unmentioned, but inextricably intertwined, is NVIDIA’s highly controversial and recently-announced GeForce Partner Program (GPP), of which there's little first-hand information, but is widely perceived as being a consumer-unfriendly project.
NVIDIA describes GPP as a consumer transparency program with partners and OEMs that include incentives such as early access to new technologies, engineering support, and joint marketing (though the distinction between market development funds and co-operative funds was not made), types of programs that are common in the industry.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Brett Taylor Net Worth</h2><time>Oct 9, 2024</time>

The Card
Unlike most GeForce cards that enter the lab, the most striking feature of the WinFast GeForce 256 DDR Revision B is not its blatant use of NVIDIA's reference design. Yes, it is true that the card is essentially NVIDIA's reference design layout with a few enhancements (discussed later), however is it not this aspect of the card that catches one attention. In the case of the WinFast GeForce 256 DDR Revision B, the huge gold heatsink and fan takes the prize for eye catcher.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>ASRock X570 Phantom Gaming 4</h2><time>Oct 8, 2024</time>

As Vulture reported early last year, Netflix's The Circle has the potential to be catfish-central! Part of the fun of the show is seeing contestants figure out who's real and who's fake - but while that may be entertaining for viewers, what's going through the contestants' minds as they navigate the show? In an exclusive interview with TheThings, Season 3's Calvin Crooks opened up about how he knew who was real and who was fake while filming, and spilled the beans on who he wasn't 100% sure about!</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Charlie Gasparino Net Worth 2024</h2><time>Oct 8, 2024</time>

GPU Performance In moving from Gemini Lake to Jasper Lake, the integrated GPU didn't get as much attention as the CPU did. While retaining the same microarchitecture, the shift to 10nm allowed for integrating more execution units and slight improvements in the maximum clocks. The systems we are looking at today come with different variants of the same GPU microarchitecture:
Intel June Canyon and ECS LIVA Z2 (Gemini Lake): 18EU @ 750 MHz ECS LIVA Z3 / JSLM-MINI (Jasper Lake): 32EU @ 850 MHz ZOTAC ZBOX CI331 nano (Jasper Lake): 24EU @ 850 MHz Based on these specifications alone, we expect the JSLM-MINI / LIVA Z3 to handily best the other systems in GPU performance.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Starchy food from Hawaii</h2><time>Oct 8, 2024</time>
