Candace is from the Sumeru region of the game, which is the newest region in the game. You could assume that the name of the new region derives from the ancient region of Sumer or Sumeria which is modern Western Asia, including Iraq and other parts of the Middle East as well."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

One fan wrote, ‚Äúkandake, latinized version candace, is the title given to dark skinned black women‚Ä¶ hoyoverse is grossly wrong for taking this name‚Ä¶ and whitewashing the character so terribly.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>kandake, latinized version candace, is the title given to dark skinned black women in real life history. hoyoverse is grossly wrong for taking this name and the legacy it‚Äôs supposed to represent and whitewashing the character so terribly. <a href=#>https://t.co/84LFpKgtlj</a></p>‚Äî sun (local gremlin) üçÅ (@faintlamps) <a href=#>August 22, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>The fan notes that Candace is the Latinized version of the name Kandake, a name given to women of dark skin throughout history, and indeed the name‚Äôs etymology stems from the term Kandake, which was given to queens during the Meroitic period. It was the name for the queens of the Kingdom of Kush, which now consists of Egypt and Sudan.</p><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>One fan even altered her coloring to make her have darker skin, which is more accurate to the history that Candace seems to be based on.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Edited ‚ù§Ô∏è <a href=#>https://t.co/GDSyYRyWFB</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/sL1kmTtX7n</a></p>‚Äî VENTI !! 246/170 SCARA ‚Ä¢ ‚òî & üê¶ (@sukiventi) <a href=#>August 22, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=837 data-injectable=true>Another Genshin Impact fan created a deep dive thread that analyzes how Hoyoverse ‚Äì the Chinese developer behind Genshin Impact ‚Äì may have taken inspiration from the history of Kandake as further proof that the whitewashing of the character may have been intentional. Their main point was that Hoyoverse based Candace on one specific figure in history, Queen Amanirenas, who lived from 40 BC to 10 BC and was blind in one eye. The Twitter user comments on this with ‚ÄúKandrake‚Äôs heterochromia appears to be a reference to this.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>according to records, Amnirense qore li kdwe li was blind in one eye (Strabo's account of a fierce one eyed Kandake).

Again, you cannot be sure that Hoyoverse was intentionally referencing the historical figure, but it certainly does not weigh in their favor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>Now it should be noted that all of the characters in Genshin Impact are fictional, but it does seem exclusionary to have a majority light-skinned roster of playable characters. However, if you are going to critique them for their historical accuracy based on what they may have based their characters on, it should be important to take all the information into account, including where they may have gotten the name for the characters, and what historical region Sumeru might be based on.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Hoyoverse has not addressed fans‚Äô complaints about the character, or the supposed whitewashing of Sumeru. Whether or not they will is most likely up to the massive fan base that Genshin Impact has, and how many of those fans share their complaints. Hopefully, the game will possess a more diverse lineup in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZonp6mo522r3nIpqeam6Ris6K60maYq51dqr1utc1mmKulo2Kuo7vUrWSdnaCesLW1zqdkqJ5do7K4ecKhmKuZk6mys7%2BMqJ1mm5%2BhvLN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./energy-plant.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Energy Plant - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
