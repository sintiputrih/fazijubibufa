The two had first met when Daym was in between jobs, long before he had made a career out of his food videos.</p><p>Ramyr has been featured on Daym's eponymous channel for years, and he even vlogged their backyard nuptials back in 2012. She's also a fixture on his Instagram feed.</p><p>In 2019, Daym shared a heartbreaking video, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About My Marriage</a>," and he discussed how he wasn't in a great place with his spouse.</p><p>Though Daym and Ramyr had reaped many benefits from his overnight success, the influencer had become much busier as a result. He admitted that he hadn't been focusing enough of his energy on his wife, and that they were "figuring things out."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"There's work that I have to do," he shared.
