With the social media platform now garnering the attention of older generations, different classes, and backgrounds, TikTok has become a space where users also post tips and tricks, beauty tutorials, and more.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Food hacks</a> have become a major trend on the app. Whether you're looking for tricks on saving an avocado from turning brown or how you can clean stained plastic containers, TikTok has become a useful tool and a great source of entertainment.&nbsp;</p><p>Most recently, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chick-fil-A employee</a> shared some money-saving hacks for customers to use when purchasing from the fast food company's menu.

TikToker @anasteeezy posted a video on July 22 claiming to be an employee of the fast food chicken chain, and decided to let her followers in on some secrets.</p><p>"I work at Chick-fil-A so I'm here to give you all the tips and tricks on secret menu items, how to get things cheaper, and just all that," she said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>She then explained that customers can order a large Arnold Palmer with four pumps of mango syrup, which is basically the same price as ordering the newest seasonal menu item, a mango passion tea, but you get it in a larger size. Who doesn't love more product for their buck?</p><p>Since the video has gone viral, the TikTok user shared another post, in which she claimed she would give consumers the lowdown on how to order frosted beverages.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>Unfortunately, the user claimed she was heading into work to get fired. "Sike guys, I thought, I'm actually on my way to get fired right now," she told her followers.&nbsp;</p><p>In another video, the viral star updated her followers about what transpired between her former employer. She claimed that after posting her first video she allegedly began getting messages from Chick-fil-A employees, which then resulted in her supposedly being fired.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>Though she was allegedly let go from her position as a Chick-fil-A employee, she still continued giving fans menu hacks. For frosted beverages, you can add oreo crumbles and different flavor syrups. You should also save your receipts because there is a survey at the bottom of each, which if you fill out, you can receive a free chicken sandwich.</p><p>Additionally, any toy in a kids' meal can be exchanged for an ice cream... for free! &nbsp;</p><p>Though Chick-fil-A has not commented on the employee's alleged dismissal, we certainly hope she continues to update fans on menu hacks that will save us chicken lovers some money!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWqr8pmnaKkXZZ6rrHNrmShmZOgwA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./viola-davis-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-273773-html.html><span>←</span><span>Viola Davis Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
