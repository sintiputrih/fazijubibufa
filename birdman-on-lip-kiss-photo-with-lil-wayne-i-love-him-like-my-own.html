That’s what that s–t really started from ’cause I thought that every night I leave, I might not ever come back.”</p><p>Birdman also expanded on his paternal connection.</p><p>“I was his father when he didn’t have a father since he was 9 years old,” he said of Wayne, <a href=#>who attempted suicide at age 12</a>. “And I love him like my own and I’d give my life for him and I’d take a life for him.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, the record producer stated that the only reputable opponent for a Verzuz battle against Wayne would be … Wayne himself.</p><figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright" readability=1><p>‘I love him like my own and I’d give my life for him and I’d take a life for him.’</p></figure><p>“Himself, Wayne versus Tunechi,” Birdman said, referencing the frequent Drake collaborator’s nickname. “He got too much s–t going on, he don’t need to touch that. Come on, brother — this is Tunechi.</p><p>“This n—-r had 100 singles in one year. He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">passed Elvis Presley in one year</a>. One hundred songs on Billboard, so I don’t think an individual could top that,” Birdman added. “The work Wayne put into it, I wouldn’t even play with that s–t.”</p><p>Birdman <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has previously addressed the smooch</a>, notably during a 2009 radio interview with Tim Westwood.</p><p>“That’s my son. If he was right here, I’d kiss him again,” he said at the time. “I kiss my daughter, my other son — you have children? Well, if you did, you’d understand what I meant with it. I just think people took that too far, man. That’s my son. I’ll do it again tomorrow; I’ll kill for him. Ride and die for him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/lil-wayne-04.jpg><p>Rapper Turk — a former member of the New Orleans-based group Hot Boys, a band signed by Cash Money Records — also spoke about the kiss in 2014. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He told VladTV</a>&nbsp;that the young members of the record label looked up to Birdman like a father figure.</p><p>“They caught them in a moment [and] the fans and the media made it into an issue that it wasn’t,” Turk said. “They’re just like the mob — they kiss each other all the time. And I’m not with Baby and them to this day, but that was just something a n—a did in house.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkp6%2FpbnAp2Sopl2htrF5yqKqrGWgnby1u4ywoK2gXaG2rXnWmrCnnV2eeq271Z5koaGdYrmqt8RmpLJln6y7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ashley-besson.html><span>←</span><span>Ashley Besson - Bio, Age, Height, In Relation, Net Worth, Facts</span></a>
