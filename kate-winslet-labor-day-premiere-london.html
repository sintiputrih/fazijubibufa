I've been wanting to drink a lot of orange juice but I don't know if that is part of it. "I wish I could be like that woman from the advert with tuna fish and banana but I wasn’t like that at all!" she quipped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/000e3fee4f3c-kate-winslet2-z.jpg><p id=eeIaMYnByGni data-wc=121>On whether she will take a long maternity leave, she replied: "Err... Ask me that on a different red carpet, I've got pregnancy brain!"In her latest film, the Oscar winner plays Adele Wheeler, a depressed single mother who with her son takes in a convict – played by Josh Brolin – during the US holiday weekend.But she is more concerned with her baby than the possibility of winning an Academy Award for the role. She said: "It hasn't even crossed my mind, I'm so absorbed in baby. "Awards season is always a huge amount of fun whether you're a part of it or not. It's always really exciting seeing what films are coming and a lot of new talent as well."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2prYWV%2Bdn2UaW9yZ5uWwaZ51qKlrKSVqXqtrcGoqWacka56sb7EpqCeqpViubC6w6ilaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./get-familiar-with-byron-scott-wife-cecelia-gutierrez.html><span>←</span><span>Get Familiar With Byron Scott Wife, Cecelia Gutierrez</span></a>
