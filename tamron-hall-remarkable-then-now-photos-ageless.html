Tamron has revealed in the past that she credits daily face masks for her glowing, youthful skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=efaCBWlASC1 data-wc=32>"I mask every single day," she told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">PeopleStyle</a>. <strong>"I mask every morning — since I was 27 years old. I don't care the brand; it can be from the drugstore or high-end."</strong></p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=ebxliyGueEo data-wc=27>She added: "I can be walking my dog in the mask scaring children and people off, but it's my routine that I commit to every single day.”&nbsp;</p><p id=emvme3Saw_i data-wc=27>Compared to recent photos of Tamron, the only noticeable difference in her appearance is her style as she now favors bold colors, tailored pieces, and figure-flattering dresses.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d9b6cfb74728-tamron-hall-2005.jpg><p id=e_46RMr_1M data-wc=19>Apart from her seemingly ageless visage, another thing that has remained constant about Tamron is her signature pixie cut.&nbsp;</p><p id=eRmNlEm8oz data-wc=25>The star has rocked her trademark 'do consistently over the years and previously explained how she first experimented with short hair when she was 18.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e885a4bbfc05-tamron-hall-2023.jpg><p id=eMaGm7TLTQ4 data-wc=44>"I cut my hair when I was 18 years old because my boyfriend at the time had a crush on [singer] Anita Baker, and I had a bigger crush on him than he did on me apparently," she shared previously on her talk show.&nbsp;</p><p id=el2pvCegpqv data-wc=52>Tamron admitted though that one family member wasn't a fan of her new look. "I remember my dad, who was in the Army for 30 years, he was like, 'But it's not feminine anymore. Because so many people associate femininity with the length of your hair. We have all this hair drama!"&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d87fd52be35c-tamron-hall-today-show.jpg><p id=en0mV0_45_ data-wc=33>However, Tamron has been subjected to "really nasty comments" from people on social media and admitted she has read the "cruelest, most awful things" about herself because of the length of her hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=ekVVlYuZdYz data-wc=31>"A person speculated about who I was as a person and even read into my personal life based solely off my hairstyle," she penned in an essay for <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Today&nbsp;</a>in 2016.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2fd675f9cbb1-tamron-hall-wearing-dolce-and-gabbana-floral-catsuit.jpg><p id=enG7zJtfsCy data-wc=38>"He or she said I must be lazy because I have short hair. It was my first encounter with something like that online, and I tried to be strong, but it was sort of devastating. Honestly, it was."&nbsp;</p><p id=ejVTfP2l6x data-wc=31>The negative comments affected Tamron so much, she started growing her hair into a "little bob" before her supportive mother stepped in. "I went immediately and cut my hair," she shared.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/70f840853f1d-tamron-hall-disney.jpg><p id=eXlEupPyKf data-wc=21><strong>"I've finally learned that this is what I like, and this is how I look best. And that's great,"&nbsp;</strong>she added.&nbsp;</p><p id=eIp10t2gmj data-wc=36>Echoing the sentiment in a previous post on Facebook, Tamron admitted that once she reverted to her shorter, cropped look: "My soul came back.
