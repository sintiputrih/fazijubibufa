He uses Instagram to share information about his latest work projects or to promote charities like Campaign Zero. However, he regularly makes public appearances with his wife of eight years, Ashley Spencer.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As Jeremy explained in a previous interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Playbill,</a> he came across Ashley's profile on Facebook, and they started dating shortly afterward. &nbsp;For their first date, they headed to a restaurant, which was followed by a karaoke bar — and the rest was history.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"We went to dinner, and we started to get drinks — I wasn't much of a drinker, but I needed a little bit of liquid courage that night. She always tells people that there was a point about half an hour in, where she was like, 'I'm going to give this kid like ten more minutes, and then we're going to call it a night.' Right about then was when the alcohol kicked in, and I opened up and stopped being shy," Jeremy told Playbill.&nbsp;</p><p>The stars got married on Sept. 8, 2012, at a beautiful wedding ceremony held at St. John's Catholic Church in Ashley's hometown of Canton, Ohio. The big event was followed by a red carpet-themed cocktail party and reception held at the Brookside Country Club, one of the finest establishments the city has on offer.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I was kind of preparing for the worst — not in like, 'She's going to leave me at the altar' kind of worst — but like, 'There's going to be some kind of drama. Family is getting together. It's supposed to rain. There's going to be all those things,'" Jeremy described his initial feelings about the wedding in an interview with Playbill.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Some of those things happened, but it was still the best day ever.
