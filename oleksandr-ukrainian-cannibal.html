He dragged the sack to the river and left it in the reeds.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-275803 alt="House Of Ukrainian Cannibal Oleksandr" width=864 height=450 data-sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/house-of-ukrainian-cannibal-oleksandr-e1587576968183.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-275803 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>ICTV</span><span class=caption-body>Oleksandr’s home in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine.</span></p><p>The couple was purportedly happily imbibing after the party when Oleksandr grabbed a kitchen knife and slit the girlfriend’s throat suddenly and with no clear motivation.</p><p>What followed was a series of gruesome events so macabre they might seem purely fictional.</p><p>After Oleksandr confirmed that his girlfriend was dead, he hacked her legs off, stuffed the rest of her into a large sack, and dragged her into the bush 1,600 feet from his house near the Inhulets River. A man and his two sons found her remains the next day.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-275807 alt="Mykola Wearing A Face Mask" width=535 height=497 data-sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mykola-wearing-a-face-mask-e1587577008878.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-275807 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>ICTV</span><span class=caption-body>Mykola and his two sons discovered the sack of human remains and immediately called the police.</span></p><p>“We were looking for a fishing spot when we stumbled upon the sack,” Mykola, the man who discovered the dismembered girlfriend, said. “I saw naked buttocks sticking out of it and realized it was human remains. I called the police.”</p><p>It didn’t take a lot of work for locals to identify the victim, who then pointed police toward the house of the woman’s boyfriend. This is when officers stepped inside the residence and caught Oleksandr preparing the woman’s leg in a frying pan. After he ate some, police placed him under arrest.</p><p>Police reportedly felt ill after taking in the scene.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-275827 alt="Pants Of Oleksandr's Victim" width=482 height=482 data-sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/pants-of-oleksandrs-victim.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-275827 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>ICTV</span><span class=caption-body>Oleksandr didn’t make an effort to hide any evidence, and simply left his victim’s pants lying in the courtyard.</span></p><p>Ultimately, the investigation into Oleksandr continues. The cannibal is currently in custody and charged with murder. Authorities naturally need to assess whether or not he acted alone before moving forward with his case.</p><p>Oleksandr is currently facing up to 15 years in prison if he is found guilty. As it turns out, there really is no free lunch.</p><p>Next up, read about <a href=#>the “cannibal couple” accused of eating up to 30 people in Russia</a>.
