To prove it, she shared a photo series on Instagram with her 730k Instagram followers, showing them a pic of her wearing the dress today versus 14 years ago.</p><p>In the accompanying caption, McPhee wrote, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs day 26 of quarantine and we‚Äôre breaking out dresses from 14 years ago. Might have to resurrect this moment, on a red carpet, once we are out of this.‚Äù</p><p>The Broadway star looked equally as fabulous 14 years ago. The main point of difference is that she had long hair that was styled in voluminous curls to perform on the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Katharine-McPhee-American-Idol-Dress-Inline.jpg><p>McPhee‚Äôs recreated the American Idol down to the little details like a microphone.

She sang <strong>Whitney Houston‚Äôs</strong> ‚ÄúI Have Nothing‚Äù just like she did on the popular singing competition. The star was the show‚Äôs runner-up for the fifth season.</p><p>McPhee has been performing on social media with Foster to encourage social distancing and entertain fans.
