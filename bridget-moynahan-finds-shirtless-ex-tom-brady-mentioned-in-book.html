Parker’s Someone to Watch Over Me by <strong>Ace Atkins</strong>. “Stumbled across something extra fun in my new book on this rainy day,” she wrote on April 11, captioning an Instagram photo of a page including the sentence, “I doubt Bridget Moynahan needed much discovering.”</p><p>Moynahan and the NFL star, 43, dated from 2004 to 2006 before the latter met <a href=#><strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong></a>. The pair share 13-year-old son <a href=#>Jack</a>, who was born not long after Brady began his relationship with the supermodel, 40.</p><p>Despite past difficulties, the exes now <a href=#>have a friendly relationship as coparents</a>. “Nothing has changed as far as Bridget and Tom coparenting,” a source told Us Weekly in February. “It’s still going well. Bridget’s someone who is friendly and easygoing and is known to be cordial with Tom and supportive of his career.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bridget-Moynahan-Finds-Ex-Tom-Brady-Shirtless-While-Reading-a-Book.jpg><p>Just last week, the Tampa Bay quarterback <a href=#>wished Moynahan a happy birthday via Instagram</a> on Wednesday, April 28. “Happy birthday @bridgetmoynahan we hope you have a GREAT day,” he wrote, captioning a photo of the actress with Jack.</p><p>Brady also shares son Benjamin, 11, and daughter Vivian, 8, with Bündchen, whom he married in 2009.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this year, Moynahan took to social media to <a href=#>congratulate the football player</a> for his <a href=#>seventh Super Bowl win</a>. “I am pretty sure I am not the only one from #patriotsnation celebrating @buccaneers,” she wrote, adding the hashtags, “#superbowl #greatgame #strong #soproud #55.”</p><p>Though she’s on good terms with him now, Moynahan has been open about the challenges she faced when Brady started dating Bündchen.</p><p>“Having a baby should have been the most joyous time of my life, but instead I felt assaulted,” she wrote in her 2019 book Our Shoes, Our Selves. “It’s unnerving to be followed and stalked like that, especially during such an emotionally vulnerable time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmZtKbAjKamsqaRna6vecWipZ2rXai1qr7TpZysq12axW7AzqZkm6qRmcZuucSnq6KnnpqxbrXNZpmop5tk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./american-bumblebee-endangered.html><span>←</span><span>American Bumblebees Are Officially On The Verge Of Extinction</span></a>
