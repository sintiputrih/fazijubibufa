Since 2020, he has held the WBA (Super), WBC, and Ring magazine titles in this weight division, and since 2021, he has also held the IBF and WBO titles.</p><p>Renowned for his boxing prowess, Canelo Álvarez is widely recognized for his exceptional counterpunching skills. He has a remarkable ability to exploit openings in his opponents’ defenses while simultaneously avoiding incoming punches through adept head and body movement.</p><p>Additionally, he is highly regarded for his proficiency as a body puncher, delivering devastating blows to his opponents’ midsections.
