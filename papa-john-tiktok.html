Whether it's challenges, dance routines, lip-sync videos, or skits, more and more people have discovered the viral app.&nbsp;</p><p>The pizza chain founder recently posted a series of TikTok videos, and in one clip he revealed his mansion a la MTV Cribs style. The sprawling home is located in Louisville, Ky., and is reportedly worth $11 million.</p><p>In the clip, viewers see an aerial shot of the mansion, revealing the huge property, which is even surrounded by a moat. When initially walking into the home, there is a massive eagle clock statue that "spins four times an hour."&nbsp;Let's just say Papa is very proud of that statue.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@thepapajohnschnatter href=#>@thepapajohnschnatter</a><p>Tour of the Papa Castle Part 1 <a title=mycrib href=#>##mycrib</a> <a title=finalsathome href=#>##finalsathome</a> <a title=fyp href=#>##fyp</a> <a title=boredinthehouse href=#>##boredinthehouse</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - thepapajohnschnatter" href=#>♬ original sound - thepapajohnschnatter</a></figure><p>When he proceeded to show fans the next room, his library, the video ended there, promising that more house tour TikToks are on the way. While he hasn't posted additional clips of his mansion, his most recent video showed off a cringy clip of himself lifting weights. "Papa bless, or papa flex," he stated.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Twitter reacts to Papa John's TikTok videos.</h2><p>Following the tacky post of John showing off his crazy mansion amid a global pandemic, people took to Twitter to share their reactions.</p><p>"Bless the poor papa johns social media intern that now has to edit tik toks of his eagle sex mansion," one person wrote. Another tweeted, "I have seen the tiktok if papa john’s house and let me just say it makes sense that their pizza is so bad because that man has no taste [sic]."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>This individual asked the question everyone was thinking: "Wait... so the first thing you see when you walk into Papa John's house, is a statue of eagles f--king? Is this a power move?"</p><p>One person commented, "This guy has THIS house with this ridiculously ostentatious clock of 2 eagles banging but said his company couldn't afford to give employees health insurance. F--k off Papa John."</p><p>Additionally, someone wrote, "'30 million Americans are out of work. I think now's a good time to release a video of my gaudy mansion.' -Papa John. The interior design of his house is equal parts Graceland and Liberace's home in Vegas."&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, the former pizza king may have given up his throne, but he's still living in a castle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa6xrYyjpqGmXam2rMDOpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mister-buddwing-ending-explained-did-james-garner-figure-who-he-really-is.html><span>←</span><span>Mister Buddwing Ending Explained, Did James Garner Figure Who He Really Is?</span></a>
