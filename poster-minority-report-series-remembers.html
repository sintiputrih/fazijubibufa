Unfortunately, the Pre-Crime Unit was dismantled in 2050, forcing law enforcement to rely on newer methods to fight crime. Before it was dismantled, Dash, his twin brother Arthur and their foster sister Agatha were part of the program that gave them their unique gifts. Now, Dash is using his ability to assist Detective Lara Vega in preventing crimes, at the same time seeking out his missing twin and trying to keep his gift from being revealed, as there are those who want to obtain the precogs at any cost.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yxu9KtnKtlnZ67sL7IrbBmqpWlvLPAjKycq6GVqHqzscyepJudoqh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-channels-princess-diana-blue-polka-dot-dress.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Middleton Channels Princess Diana in a Bright Blue Polka-Dot Dress</span></a>
