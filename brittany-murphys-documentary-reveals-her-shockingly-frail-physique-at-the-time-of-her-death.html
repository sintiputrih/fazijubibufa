Her smile was infectious, and her kindness and sweet demeanor touched everyone that she interacted with.</p><h2 id=the-shocking-details>The Shocking Details</h2><p>Brittany Murphy died so suddenly, that <a href=#>fans and loved ones were left reeling</a> and searching for answers. Sadly, the answers they initially uncovered, only led to more questions and there was a lot of ambiguity surrounding the role her husband, Simon Monjack, had in her death. Just as people were starting to scratch the surface to uncover what really happened to Brittany, and as the spotlight started to focus on Monjack's involvement in her demise, he too, died of similar causes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The documentary covering this bizarre story has taken a deep dive into Brittany's last days, and shocking revelations have been uncovered surrounding her physical frailty. The coroner's report indicated her cause of death as being a combination of <a href=#>untreated pneumonia</a> and a cocktail of medications used to treat those symptoms, leading to drug intoxication. This was paired with anemia and it was made clear that no illegal substances were found in her system.</p><p>Those closest to Brittany and now telling the tale of the state she was in during her final days, and the warning signs were clearly there.</p><p>Brittany's makeup artist, Trista Jordan, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the media</a>; "Her eyes were so sunken, and she just seemed so sad." She went on to say; "She wasn't herself. She was in so much pain. She had Bambi legs and couldn't stand up."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Was Brittany Murphy Ever Really Eminem's Girlfriend?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brittany-was-broken-down>Brittany Was Broken Down</h2><p>Brittany seemed to be physically and psychologically broken down, and her spirits seemed crushed. The description of her legs being similar to those of Bambi gave fans a harrowing depiction of her alarmingly frail stature and indicated that whatever she was going through had been happening for a long time.</p><p>Her death may have seemed sudden to fans, who were unable to peer into her life behind closed doors, but those who observed her in the days and weeks leading up to her death were able to see that she was truly suffering, and not just from her illness.</p><p>The documentary goes on to shred the reputation of Monjack, giving examples of his sketchy, controlling, and some may say, abusive behavior towards his pregnant ex-girlfriend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How These Celebrities Reacted To The Death Of Tupac Shakur</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq6Gkqa6vxYymrKuomK7AbrDOnKymnZ6prrPFjKucr52RocButMSrZKygn5i4qrrGpbBmnqKWtq15z6GwrKGhqrJurdNmq6GdXam2rrGMqJ1moJWneqWxwK2faA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./206371-breaking-news-penny-banner-passes-away.html><span>←</span><span>Breaking News: Penny Banner Passes Away</span></a>
