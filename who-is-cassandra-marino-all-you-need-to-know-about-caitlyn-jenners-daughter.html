Cassandra Marino’s parents are Caitlyn Jenner and Chrystie Scott. While Caitlyn’s mother is an actress best known for TV shows and films like ESPN SportsCentury and SST: Death Flight, Caitlyn is a former Olympic gold medalist and television personality. Her parents divorced in 1981, a year after she was born. Her mother married Richard Scott following the divorce. In addition, her father married twice before undergoing a gender identity transformation.</span></p><p><span>The interior designer has one older biological brother and seven step-siblings from Caitlyn Jenner’s side. Burt Jenner is her biological brother. She is, however, Kim Kardashian’s step-sibling along with Rob, Kourtney, Kendall, Brody Jenner, and Kylie Jenner. But she’s the elusive one, not like any of her other siblings.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Cassandra-Marino-1.webp alt="Who Is Cassandra Marino?

Like her personal account, the Simple White Farmhouse page is privately managed by her. It draws attention to her love of architecture, interiors, and other elements. Because of her seclusion, Casey is regarded as the most elusive Jenner.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cassandra_Marinos_Personal_Life></span><b>Cassandra Marino’s Personal Life</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The LA-born interior designer is married to Michael Marino. The pair allegedly exchanged vows in front of their immediate family during a private ceremony. They are currently blessed with two boys and one girl among their three children. Francesca Marino, Luke Marino, and Isabella Marino are their names. At the moment, the family is based in Los Angeles, California, in the United States.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Cassandra-Marino-2.webp alt="Who Is Cassandra Marino?

She declared to the press that Caitlyn was a far superior mother than Bruce Jenner. The connection between Bruce and Cassandra was more strained, and they didn’t talk much. They also never talked about anything that had transpired in their lives.</span></p><p><span>Caitlyn’s relationship with her kid has transformed after completing the transition surgery; she is now much more tender and caring than she was before. It appears that Caitlyn Jenner enjoys spending time with her kids and is more involved in their lives.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cassandra_Marinos_Net_Worth></span><b>Cassandra Marino’s Net Worth</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>It is said that her net worth is about $2 million.
