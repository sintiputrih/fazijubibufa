What a beautiful family, and I love [Mexico], my old home." Another remarked: "Apple is a Bridget Bardot twin!"&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Do not miss</h4><p id=eZe3CMeW_V data-wc=60>Some were quick to point out that Apple - who is currently studying at Vanderbilt University - looks very much like her father, Coldplay musician Chris Martin. "And her father's twin," said one, while another added: "She looks like her father with her grandmothers eyes. Beautiful." Another post read: "Apple is the perfect mix of Margot Tenenbaum & Chris Martin."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/359bf515b826-apple-martin.jpg><p id=evkufiHyxf data-wc=40>Gwyneth shares both her children with ex-husband <a class=hm-link href=#>Chris Martin</a>, whom she was married to from 2003 to 2016, and in 2018, the actress tied the knot with <a class=hm-link href=#>Brad Falchuk</a>, who is a dad to his own children, Isabella and Brody.&nbsp;</p><p id=eG3-bwuHAC data-wc=62>Last month, the 51-year-old star opened up to People about Apple and how much she is loving student life. "I mean, she's just so much fun to be with," explained Gwyneth. "It's so wonderful having a daughter because you have this amazing best friend and we like to do the same stuff, and she's so funny and she's so smart. It's amazing."&nbsp;</p><p id=erZH7K26xH data-wc=28>The actress added: "My children are similar in the ways that they're both incredibly sensitive and empathetic. They really can feel people's stuff very permeable in that way.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/16936a86856d-apple-moses-martin.jpg><p id=eSJcfB_cXH data-wc=63>"They're both tall and they both have very interesting ways of seeing the world, and they're different in the ways that they are. My daughter's very much of an extrovert. My son is an introvert. They like to do very different things, but then I don't know, then they both love to snowboard and they both love music, and they love their friends."&nbsp;</p><p id=eZZdu6mBto data-wc=45>In 2020, during an appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show, Gwyneth discussed co-parenting with her ex Chris, and said: "We have this idea that just because we break up we can't love the things about the person anymore that we loved and that's not true."&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: A look at celebrities with their children</figure><p id=eycIZnt4uS data-wc=56>She added: "It's like you're ending a marriage but you're still in a family. That's how it will be forever. "Some days it's not as good as it looks. We also have good days and bad days, but I think it's driving towards the same purpose of unity and love and what's best for [our kids]."&nbsp;</p><p id=eDbmtxiCKw data-wc=29>The mum-of-two explained: "No matter what you think, how you think you were wronged or how bad you perceive the other person's actions, or whatever the case may be.&nbsp;</p><p id=emCz-QvWKX data-wc=48>"If you are brave enough to take responsibility for your half and really look at your own garbage and your own trauma and how it's presenting in the world and in your relationship, then there really is somewhere to go and something to learn and something to heal."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dn2PaWluZ5esxq%2Bx06FkqZmcqb%2Bww4ypn6isn6h6s63RnqOyZaOasq95w5qsoKCkmr9urc%2Bpo55lo6S7brnOrJysZZ2axaqvzmafqKSZma66ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dating-history-of-kathryn-dennis-and-chleb-ravenell.html><span>←</span><span>Dating History Of Kathryn Dennis And Chleb Ravenell</span></a>
