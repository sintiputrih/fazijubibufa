What wind speed cancels flights?  As many factors can impact a flight’s ability to take off or land during bad weather, there is no set wind speed that will ground a plane. During Storm Dennis in 2020, winds reached 90mph causing many flights to be interrupted – however Storm Eunice is expected to see winds of more than 100mph."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
