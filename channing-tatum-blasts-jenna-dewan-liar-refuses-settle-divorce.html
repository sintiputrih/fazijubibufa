While acknowledging Dewan's rightful claim to a portion of the proceeds from Magic Mike, Channing’s legal team argues his post-separation profits should be regarded as distinct assets deserving of consideration.</p><p>Channing has made millions through the Magic Mike franchise, reportedly earning a $21 million for the sequel Magic Mike XXL , released in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, with Tatum's reported net worth standing at $80 million and Jenna's personal fortune at $30 million, the financial gap between them is striking, with Tatum's wealth nearly tripling that of his ex-wife.</p><p>Jenna and Channing first met on the set of their 2006 film Step Up, where they first met.
