During the last season of <i>KUWTK</i>, Kim and her mother, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kris Jenner</a>, visited two doctors who warned of the life-threatening health risks that could result from a third pregnancy.

There are situations where retained placenta could be life or death."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her mother was frank at the time: "You could bleed to death," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jenner, it seems, hasn't changed her tune since then.
