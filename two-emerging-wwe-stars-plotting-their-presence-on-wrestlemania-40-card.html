The Australian WWE Superstar has a knack for getting under the skin of just about anyone in the world right now. Now it appears he and Carmelo Hayes aspire to be on the WrestleMania 40 card.</p><p>The Australian star became one of the biggest heels in NXT thanks to his excellent character work and in-ring psychology during the matches. Therefore it was no surprise he was eventually called up to the main roster.</p><p>Both Grayson Waller and Carmelo Hayes proved themselves to be top stars during their time in NXT and they even feuded with each other for some time. While speaking on&nbsp;<a href=#>The Daily Ticket</a>, Grayson Waller revealed that e and Carmelo Hayes promised each other to compete at WrestleMania 40.</p><p>“I don’t think there is any point in having goals if they are not lofty. If you say, ‘I want to go to the gym today,’ great. I’m a WWE superstar, I can’t have simple goals. If I have simple goals as a WWE superstar, I’m just another guy. Do you want to be a WWE superstar or do you want to be a great one? There is a huge gap between that. With WrestleMania, I’ve never performed (there). Last year, after (NXT) Stand & Deliver, myself and Carmelo Hayes got to sit and watch in the skybox and watch WrestleMania. We looked at each other and it wasn’t a situation of ‘wow, this is so cool.’ It was, ‘that’s where we are going to be next year.’ We told each other that. That’s my goal,.”</p><p>Grayson Waller also made&nbsp;<a href=#>it clear he is in WWE to put down legends</a>. We will have to wait and see whether Waller and Carmelo Hayes will eventually get to compete at WrestleMania 40 next year.</p><p>What match do you want to see headline WrestleMania 40 next year?
