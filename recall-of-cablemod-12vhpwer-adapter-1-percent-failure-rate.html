<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Recall of CableMods' 12VHPWR Adapters Estimates Failure Rate of 1.07%</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>A recall on 12VHPWR angled adapters from CableMod has reached its next stage this week, with the publication of a <a href=#>warning document</a> from&nbsp;the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Referencing the original recall for CableMods'&nbsp;V1.0 and V1.1 adapters, which kicked off&nbsp;<a href=#>back in December</a>, the CPSC notice marks the first involvement of government regulators. And with that has come to light a bit more detail on just how big the recall is overall, along with an estimated failure rate for the adapters of a hair over 1%.</p><p>According to the CPSC notice, CableMod is recalling 25,300 adapters, which were sold between February, 2023, and December, 2023. Of those, at least 272 adapters failed, as per reports and repair claims made to CableMod. That puts the failure rate for the angled adapters at 1.07%&nbsp;– if not a bit higher due to the&nbsp;underreporting that can happen with self-reported statistics. All told, the manufacturer has received at least $74,500 in property damage claims in the United States, accounting for the failed adapters themselves, as well as the video card and anything else damaged in the process.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/21261/cablemod-angled-adapter-1_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>As part of the recall, CableMod has asked owners of its angled 12VHPWR adapters V1.0 and V1.1 to stop using them immediately, and to destroy them to prevent future use. Buyers can opt for a full refund of $40, or a $60 store credit.</p><p>It is noteworthy that, despite the teething issues with the initial design of the 12VHPWR connector – culminating with the PCI-SIG replacing it with the upgraded 12V-2x6 standard – the issue with the CableMod adapters is seemingly distinct from those larger design flaws. Specifically, CableMod's recall cites issues with the male portion of their adapters, which was not altered in the 12V-2x6 update. Compared to 12VHPWR, 12V-2x6 only alters female plugs (such as those found on video cards themselves), calling for shorter sensing pins and longer conductor terminals. Male plugs, on the other hand, remain unchanged, which is why existing PSU cables made for the 12VHPWR remain compatible (and normally safe) with 12V-2x6 video cards. Though as cable mating is a two-way dance, it's unlikely having to plug into inadequate 12VHPWR female connectors did CableMod any favors here.</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Consumer Product Safety Commission</a>, <a href=#>HotHardware</a>, <a href=#>CableMod</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH9yfpVqZqudk5a5rXnOn2ScmZKhsq67w2Zoa66YpcSmvoyam5qopJq%2Fbn2MqZyrm5WjwW6ywKKjrqqVYr%2BiwMQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./poor-performance-fueled-sumners-conquest-of-two-national-high-school-records.html><span>←</span><span>Poor performance fueled Will Sumners conquest of high school records</span></a>
