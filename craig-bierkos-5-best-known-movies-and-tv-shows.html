Galouye’s 1964 novel Simulacron-3 right? Jokes aside, it was one of the earliest sci-fi stories to tackle the concept of what we might call virtual reality today. The Thirteenth Floor is loosely based on that book. It might have been remembered as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the best sci-fi films</a> out there, had it not launched just one month after this indie film I bet you’ve never heard of — The Matrix.</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false>Bierko plays three different characters in the film: John Ferguson, Douglas Hall, and David. Even saying that might spoil too much and ruin the film’s twist, so I’ll say no more!</p><h2 id=h-cinderella-man data-injectable=false>Cinderella Man</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Cinderella Man is one of those fondly remembered and extremely well-reviewed movies that just, sadly, didn’t have that box office magic, so it was technically a dud. This dramatic sport biopic dramatizes the life of former world heavyweight boxing champion James J. Braddock.</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>While Russell Crowe, Renée Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti were the heavy-hitting names on the posters for the film, Bierko played the ultimate antagonist of the movie, heavyweight boxing champion Max Baer, who had literally killed other boxers in the ring before. This underdog story is perfect for boxing fans and we have Bierko to thank for it.</p><h2 id=h-the-long-kiss-goodnight data-injectable=false>The Long Kiss Goodnight</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true>When an action film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has Samuel L. Jackson in it</a>, you know it’s going to be good! The story follows Samantha Caine, an amnesiac schoolteacher who hires private detective Jackson to help her figure out the truth behind her true identity. A dark conspiracy is uncovered, and Bierko, as a psychological-operations specialist, is a major part of it.</p><h2 id=h-scary-movie-4 data-injectable=false>Scary Movie 4</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>Love them or hate them, the Scary Movie franchise was an absolute horror-parody powerhouse for quite some time. Bierko plays Tom Ryan, an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">absolutely incompetent father</a> who has quite the scene parodying Tom Cruise’s famous moment on The Oprah Winfrey Show.</p><h2 id=h-boston-legal data-injectable=false>Boston Legal</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=false>While it never was huge TV ratings hit, Boston Legal recieved 26 Primetime Emmy Award nominations and absolutely deserved them. The show was the continuation of the wildly successful legal drama The Practice. Bierko’s time on the show as lawyer Jeffrey Coho spanned 14 episodes in the show’s third season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ykvsCinmaamZq%2FrLvSZmxmmpWowW63zaiup2WdpMOqsdJmmKecXanDbr%2FHqK6sZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bobby-mukherjee.html><span>←</span><span>Bobby Mukherjee</span></a>
