He is also known for working at Orange County Choppers. His career has been active since 2003.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Rick Petko is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Rick’s net worth is over $1.75 million, accumulated not only through his successful career as a craftsman, but also through his successful involvement in the entertainment industry as a reality television personality.</p><h3>Rick Petko Net Worth $1.75 Million</h3><p>Rick Petko spent his childhood in his hometown. Other information about his early life and education is unknown in the media, except that when he was only seven years old, he began riding not only bikes, but also mini-bikes, dirt bikes, go karts, three-wheels, four-wheels, etc. He soon became also a huge fun of motorcycles, so he made a decision to start pursuing a career as a manufacturer of motorcycles, as well as riding them.</p><p>At the beginning of his career, Rick worked for five years at Pocono Raceway, a racing school, and with Hooters Pro Cup Team. Then in July of 2003, when the reality TV series “American Choppers” began filming, he was hired as a skilled craftsman by Orange County Choppers, better known as OCC, a worldwide company which manufactures motorcycles. When he started working there, the first major project on which he worked was a POW/MIA bike, named after his cousin. Thus, when the show began to air on the Discovery Channel, he very soon became one of the favorite members of the show, as he presented himself as one of the hardest working men in the company. This increased immensely his popularity and added a considerable amount to his net worth.<br>Parallel with that job, Rick founded his own shop called RPD & Co. in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, and during the show, he worked there as well. However, the show ended in 2010, and after that he worked at OCC until 2016, when he quit. However, in the meantime he also appeared in the 2014 TV special “American Chopper: Shaq Bike”, which also contributed to his wealth.</p><p>Currently, Rick works as a custom fabricator at the Pocono Mountain Harley Davidson company, and now he is a part of another reality TV series entitled “American Chopper: Senior Vs Junior”. His net worth is certainly still rising.</p><p>When it comes to speak about his personal life, Rick Petko has been married to Brittany Cockeram since 2012; the couple has two daughters together. Their current residence is in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. In his spare time, he is very active across many of the most popular social media platforms, including Twitter and Instagram, on which he has a huge number of followers.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=1.7388059701493><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Rick Petko</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.75 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 11, 1968</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Bath, Pennsylvania USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Harvard University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Brittany Cockeram (m ? - 2012)</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1542816/</a></td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>American Chopper</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=1.2606382978723><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2.4943820224719><td>1</td><td>During the building of the <a href=#>Lance Armstrong</a> bike, got his hand mashed in the drill press.</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqugnKNdpbK1t85mpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nikki-deloach-wants-a-new-holiday-hallmark-movie-with-andrew-walker.html><span>←</span><span>Nikki DeLoach Wants a New Holiday Hallmark Movie With Andrew Walker</span></a>
