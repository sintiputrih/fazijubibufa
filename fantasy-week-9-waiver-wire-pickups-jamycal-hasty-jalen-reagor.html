He now faces the Chargers, who are giving up the sixth-most fantasy points to quarterbacks this season, and is a worth a look if you need a bye week fill-in or are streaming QBs.</p><h3>Drew Lock, Denver Broncos (10%)</h3><p>You could do worse than Lock, who is fresh off of his best fantasy performance to date in Week 8 against the Chargers. He completed 26 of 41 attempts for three touchdowns and one interception and finished as QB7. The Broncos travel to Atlanta, which has given up the most fantasy points to quarterbacks all year.</p><h2>Running backs</h2><h3>Damien Harris, New England Patriots (47% rostered)</h3><p>Harris appears to be the running back du jour for Bill Belichick, who is notoriously mercurial when it comes to the position. He saw 16 carries for 102 yards and a touchdown, while Rex Burkhead saw just six carries for 26 yards. Harris isn’t involved in the passing game, but his workload alone should keep him in the low-end RB2 range, especially in non-PPR formats. He also has a fantastic Week 9 matchup on the road against the Jets, who have given up the eighth-most points to running backs this season.</p><h3>JaMycal Hasty, San Francisco 49ers (42%)</h3><p>Tevin Coleman <a href=#>re-injured his knee during the first quarter of Sunday’s game</a> after missing five games on IR. Hasty stepped in and saw 12 carries for 29 yards, including a touchdown, and caught a 2-yard pass while Jerick McKinnon saw a limited role for the second week in a row. McKinnon had three carries for -1 yard and a touchdown and caught four of four targets for 40 yards. Hasty is the preferred back of the two.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/jamycal-hasty-jalen-reagor-2020-week-9-waiver-wire-fantasy-football.jpg><h3>Gus Edwards, Baltimore Ravens (30%)</h3><p>Edwards and rookie J.K. Dobbins split carries out of the Ravens’ backfield on Sunday with Mark Ingram sidelined. Edwards had 16 carries for 87 yards and a touchdown and Dobbins had 15 carries for 113 yards and an 8-yard catch. Dobbins (68 percent rostered) has the edge between the two, but Edwards will have a role in this run-heavy offense. He is a flex add this week against the Colts, especially if Ingram continues to miss time.</p><h3>DeeJay Dallas, Seattle Seahawks (25%)</h3><p>Dallas dominated the Seattle backfield on Sunday with Chris Carson (foot) and Carlos Hyde (hamstring) out. He saw 18 carries for 41 yards and caught five of five targets for 17 yards. He had one rushing and one receiving touchdown. Head coach Pete Carroll <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seemed unsure of Hyde and Carson’s statuses</a> on Monday, with both uncertain for Week 9 in Buffalo. Dallas would be a solid RB2 play if both miss the game.</p><h3>Wayne Gallman Jr., New York Giants (24%)</h3><p>Gallman has stepped up with Devonta Freeman (ankle) sidelined and has scored in two straight games. He saw 12 carries for 44 yards and a touchdown, as well as one catch for 18 yards against Tampa’s stout run defense on Monday. His ceiling is limited by the Giants’ struggling offense, but he should be the lead back in this offense so long as Freeman is sidelined.</p><h2>Wide receivers</h2><h3>Marvin Jones Jr., Detroit Lions (49% rostered)</h3><p>Golladay <a href=#>suffered a hip injury during Sunday’s game</a> against the Colts and could be a candidate for injured reserve. He will miss at least a week, which will mean more targets to go around for the Lions’ pass catchers. Jones caught three of seven targets for 39 yards and should see more involvement this week in a favorable road matchup against the Vikings, whose secondary is very exploitable.</p><h3>Corey Davis, Tennessee Titans (48%)</h3><p>Davis led the Titans in receiving on Sunday and caught eight of 10 passes for 128 yards and scored for the second week in a row. It was also his second straight week with 10 targets, partially due to the injury to Adam Humphries (concussion) in the second quarter. The Titans will face the Bears in Week 9 which downgrades Davis slightly into WR3/flex territory.</p><h3>Allen Lazard, Green Bay Packers (34%)</h3><p>Lazard is on injured reserve after undergoing core muscle surgery early in the season, but has been practicing and could return as early as this week against the 49ers. He posted two top-13 finishes in his three appearances this year as the Packers’ much-needed WR2 behind superstar Davante Adams. He is an upside WR2 play if healthy in Green Bay’s high-scoring offense.</p><h3>Jalen Reagor, Philadelphia Eagles (24%)</h3><p>The Eagles have a Week 9 bye, but don’t overlook adding Reagor if you can afford to do so. He returned from a five-game absence dealing with a thumb injury and caught three of six targets for 16 yards and a touchdown, and scored a two-point conversion on Sunday. The Eagles face the Giants, Browns, Seahawks, Packers, Saints, Cardinals and Cowboys for the remaining weeks of the fantasy season, none of whom have particularly fearsome secondaries. He should add some much-needed depth to the Eagles’ receiving corps alongside breakout Travis Fulgham.</p><h2>Tight ends</h2><h3>Trey Burton, Indianapolis Colts (22% rostered)</h3><p>Burton caught three of four targets for 9 yards and scored a rushing touchdown out of the wildcat formation for the second week in a row. He is the best tight end of Colts’ group ahead of Mo Alie-Cox and Jack Doyle and could see more targets if T.Y. Hilton misses time after suffering a groin injury in Week 8.</p><h3>Jordan Reed, San Francisco 49ers (3%)</h3><p>Kittle <a href=#>suffered a fractured foot in Sunday’s loss to the Seahawks</a> and will miss at least eight weeks. Next up on the depth chart are Ross Dwelley — who connected with Nick Mullens for a touchdown last week — and Reed, who could return from injured reserve this week. It’s worth noting that Reed is injured more often than not, but he is the preferred option over Dwelley when healthy. Reed could be a valuable asset in this 49ers offense that likes to utilize tight ends and is extremely banged up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3F7kGpmaWtfm66vwMCssGavlZq4boWMsJiirpWneri10Z5kqaGToMKxv4yjmKaxk5a5brTArKuyZZqWuaa6jKucmp%2Bfp3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./competes-j-b-hunt-transport-services.html><span>←</span><span>Who Competes with J.B.
