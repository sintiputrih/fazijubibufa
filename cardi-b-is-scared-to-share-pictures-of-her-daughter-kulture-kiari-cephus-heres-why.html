Offset even goes where some men do not tread, which is the area of changing diapers. “He is changing diapers, but I’ve been seeing Offset being a dad,” Cardi B tells ET. “He already has three kids, so I already fell in love with the way that he was a dad already. I’m like, ‘Oh my god, I can have a little one with this guy.’ He’s really good.”</p><p></p><p>Cardi B and Offset have one child together.
