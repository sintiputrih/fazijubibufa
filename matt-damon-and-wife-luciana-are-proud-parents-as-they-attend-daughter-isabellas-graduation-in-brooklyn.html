News in 2021. The actor humorously noted that Isabella tends to watch his films only if the reviews are less than favorable. “If they come out and they're good, she's going to pass... She's looking for ammunition all the time,” he joked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fb43b58dba5f-bguk2949075016-2.jpg><p id=e1zYEv9sX7t data-wc=24>The Damon-Barroso family is a tight-knit unit.

During an interview with Tara Hitchcock in 2021, he revealed, “Last Christmas, my wife and I gave my 15-year-old a life-size cardboard cutout of Harry Styles. Harry Styles did a little video and said 'Hello' to her, and she lost her mind. I think that was the best we've done so far. I don't know how we'll top it.”</p><p id=e6bS1EyGNCU data-wc=32>He did manage to outdo himself by taking Isabella and her younger sisters to a Harry Styles concert. Matt was in awe watching Isabella sing along, knowing “every word to every song.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/29d5be28cd9b-matt-damon-luciana-barroso-if-premiere.jpg><p id=et2pRy6_Cxz data-wc=39>Reflecting on the experience, he told People, “It was great. Yeah, it was great. They love him. And that album dropped, or at least I became aware of it, during the first lockdown. So we had that on repeat.”</p><p id=epPKrTIBumZ data-wc=54>Isabella’s birth in 2006 marked a turning point in Matt’s life, shifting his priorities. “I really used to have no life outside movies. I'd work all day, go to the gym, and go to sleep,” he told the UK's Sunday Express. “Now I have a place to be, so I come home after work.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e0abebdbfe6f-gettyimages-2151777533.jpg><p id=eE0v5muHqP4 data-wc=55>The love story of Matt and Luciana began in April 2003 when they met while he was filming Stuck On You in Miami, and she was working in a bar. Their whirlwind romance led to an engagement in September 2005, followed by a private civil ceremony at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau nearly three months later.</p><p id=ew35d8uyyvc data-wc=21>The couple has been inseparable ever since, often gracing events with their united presence, including the 2024 Met Gala last month.&nbsp;</p><p id=eFwBSnBesLJ data-wc=37>At the glamorous event, Matt humorously confessed it took him 'about five minutes' to get ready, as he quipped to People while departing from the Mark Hotel, “We've been in the room all day.
