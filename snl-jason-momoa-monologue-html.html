But the subject matter proved to be much more representative of his character, with the <a href=#>Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom</a> star fittingly speaking all about his lifelong love for the ocean. Momoa explained that his childhood dream of becoming a marine biologist (“which makes sense because I’m built like a scientist”) inspired him to move from landlocked Iowa, where he grew up, back to Hawaii, where he was born. While he didn’t become a marine biologist, he got the next best thing: a role on Baywatch. “I only stayed for a few seasons because you really don’t want to get stuck in the B-hole,” he said, before explaining that his love of the ocean has come full circle. “I do a lot of work <a href=#>protecting</a> our oceans and small island nations,” he said, “I even started my own water company to eliminate single-use plastic water bottles. It’s called Mananalu, which in Hawaiian stands for ‘Suck it Dasani.’”</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cll8g73fk00000qe14iwrdv88@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Jason Momoa Urges Tourists to Stay Away from Maui</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clme9lhqb00000pgvz7iz8ejz@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom Arrives After Three Rounds of Reshoots</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clp50x7hl00000ie3zcrxo0gj@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Emma Stone Is Joining SNL’s Five-Timers Club</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Jason Momoa’s SNL Monologue Goes Swimmingly</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdhZny0ustmoZqrn6N6rrvMqJhmpZ%2BjvK27xq6cZ6Ckork%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./36445-album-cover-and-tracklist-revealed-for-chinx-s-welcome-to-jfk-news.html><span>←</span><span>Album Cover &amp;amp; Tracklist Revealed For Chinxs Welcome To JFK</span></a>
