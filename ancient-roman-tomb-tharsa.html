Thought to be a symbol of power and strength, ancient people also believed that it had the power to “cleanse” evil spirits.</p><h2>The Bull Heads Found At The Turuş Rock Tomb In Tharsa</h2><p>Excavations at Tharsa Ancient City in southeastern Türkiye began in 2021 and have since revealed a number of fascinating archaeological finds. Most recently, excavations of Tharsa’s necropolis have unearthed the Turuş Rock Tombs, which are a type of tomb carved directly into the bedrock.</p><p>“Tharsa Ancient City consists of 3 main archaeological areas: Big Mound, Small Mound and Necropolis Area,” said Mustafa Çelik, Deputy Director of Adıyaman Museum. “We started excavations in the necropolis area in 2024. We added [two] more rock tombs to the rock tombs we had previously uncovered. One of them is the rock tomb we identified today.”</p><p>Like other rock tombs, this one descends into the earth via a staircase of 10-13 steps. Many rock tombs display figures on their walls and doorways, and this one features two fearsome, horned bulls.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-490285 alt="Roman Tomb At Tharsa" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bulls-heads-in-tomb.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-490285 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Adıyaman Museum</span><span class=caption-body>A close-up of the bull heads discovered in the ancient rock tomb.</span></p><p>“This tomb, which consists of a main space and three arcosolium [an arched recess], has [two] bull’s head figures on the upper part of the entrance, which we call bukranyon in ancient times,” Çelik explained. “In the middle part of the bull heads, there are decorations called girlants [garlands] and rosettes.”</p><p>The necropolis dates from the third century C.E. to the Byzantine Era, a span of time in which bull heads were important symbols for ancient Romans.</p><h2>The Use Of Bull Motifs In Ancient Rome</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Arkeo News</a>, archaeologists in Tharsa Ancient City believe that the bull heads at the entrance of the newly unearthed rock tomb were meant to “cleanse” the grave’s owner of evil spirits.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-490305 alt="Tharsa Tombs" width=900 height=601 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tarsa-tombs.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-490305 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>IHA</span><span class=caption-body>Located near Kuyulu village in southeastern Türkiye along the ancient Adıyaman-Şanlıurfa Highway, Tharsa contains a wealth of tombs.</span></p><p>But carved bull heads adorned with garlands, known as bucranium, could mean different things in the ancient world. The carved bull head descended from the earlier practice of displaying real heads of sacrificial oxen on temple walls, and later became an important architectural detail.</p><p>In <a href=# rel=noopener>ancient Rome</a>, the bull sometimes was associated with Jupiter (Zeus to ancient Greeks) or with Mars (the Greek god Ares). It could symbolize power, fertility, and strength, and appeared on coins and the walls of temples.</p><p>According to legend, the bull could also take on more sinister forms, both in terms of the rumored <a href=# rel=noopener>brazen bull</a> torture device that saw victims burned alive inside it, as well as the fearsome mythological beast known as the <a href=# rel=noopener>Minotaur</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-490306 alt="Bull Heads At Tharsa" width=900 height=573 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bull-heads-at-tarsa.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-490306 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>IHA</span><span class=caption-body>Bull heads, known as Bucranium, were common throughout ancient Greece and Rome, symbolizing power and strength.</span></p><p>The bull heads discovered at the rock tomb in Tharsa Ancient City are one small part of the larger archaeological effort at the site. Located along the route of a once major Roman highway stretching from Doliche to Samosata, the site includes the necropolis and and two settlement mounds.</p><p>Archaeologists have previously found 60 graves at the necropolis, and continue to make new discoveries. They’re hopeful that the region — which, today, is located along the Adıyaman-Şanlıurfa Highway — can draw in tourists who are interested in ancient history.</p><p>After reading about the bull heads carved into a Roman-era rock tomb in Türkiye, discover the story of <a href=#>Baiae</a>, the sunken party town of ancient Rome. Then, learn about <a href=#>decimation</a>, the brutal Roman punishment used by military leaders to discipline insubordinate soldiers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyiusKinKesXae8rq3NZquopZJiwamt0ayY</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-carradine-facts.html><span>←</span><span>John Carradine Facts</span></a>
