Here's how the mystery unfolds</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Spoilers for 'Red Rose'</p><p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: Netflix's ' begins with Rochelle (played by Isis Hainsworth), downloading a mysterious app named Red Rose and it slowly starts to take over her choices, subsequently costing her life. Trouble begins to loom over Rochelle's friend group, who tries to find the real reason behind the death of their best friend. Wren (played by ), best friend of Rochelle, downloads the app herself with the intention to find the truth, which puts her and the rest of the gang in danger. The app gets the best of them and what's worse is it makes the group and their loved ones a live target.</p><p>With zero clue in knowing what is actually happening around them and with no one to believe them, the gang tries to escape the deadly consequences on their own while trying to find the truth. This is when a saviour comes in the form of Jaya (played by ), an intelligent young woman with a knack for codes, who helps the group in finding out about the mysterious and sinister person behind the curtain. The gang almost succeeds in their mission, when they begin to realise it is not as easy as it seems to destroy the high-functioning 'Red Rose'. The ending of the series left with a lead to the next chapter, where the deadly app is taking a newer form in Tokyo. 's 'Red Rose' definitely had several moments to stir us up and left us with several unanswered questions like: Did Jaya start following The Gardner? Is Jaya's life in danger? Will 'Red Rose' come to the spotlight?</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><h2 class=split>Did Jaya start following The Gardner?</h2><p>Jaya is the character in 'Red Rose' who changed the trajectory of the story by exposing the group to the existence of the dark web and the role of Red Rose in it. She tracks down the origin of the Red Rose with her exceptional computer skills. Jaya is also the one who finds out about Simon's (boyfriend of Wren's mother) involvement with the Red Rose. Everyone believes Simon is the high-ranking member of Red Rose (named The Gardner) and closes the case. But it is Jaya, who kept on working the case, finds out the Red Rose is still working and she even met the mysterious The Gardner. It becomes clear that with this persistent attitude, Jaya will not sleep and she will always keep a tab on the deadly Red Rose, even though she has deleted its existence. Jaya is aware of the newer version of Red Rose now starting to bloom in Tokyo and will try to take it down as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e9edae88-a239-4f55-b9c0-4a790ff36fcf.png><h2 class=split>Is Jaya's life in danger?</h2><p>Jaya is fearless, intelligent and consistent throughout the series which makes her a threat to Red Rose. After the deadly group of Red Rose finds out about Jaya's breaching into their website and helping her friends to escape from the plans of Red Rose, they try to kill Jaya by setting fire to her house. Though Jaya escapes and secretly helps the gang till the end, Jaya becomes a target once again by coming in direct contact with The Gardner at the end. Now, Jaya knows about The Gardner's identity. The latter confirmed that Jaya has escaped the fire, which makes both of them vulnerable. Moreover, The Gardner now knows that Jaya has deleted their website, whereas she realises it is not the end of it. So with Jaya as a potential threat, Red Rose will try to silence her, making Jaya a live target.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/44bc7903-b5cd-4089-afa9-7b03ecd2f223.png><h2 class=split>Will 'Red Rose' come to the spotlight?</h2><p>By the end of the series, we see Red Rose appearing in Tokyo, with an updated white and gold colour scheme. And it poses the question of whether they are the same Red Rose or a different one. It is also to be noted that after Jaya completely wiped out the existence of Red Rose, The Gardner has claimed that there is no end to an 'idea', hinting that the website and the app will be back in a different form. With Red Rose now expanding to a larger scale, the dark web group runs a chance of being exposed to the public.</p><p>The final scene in Tokyo has opened up the world of 'Red Rose' on a larger scale, with endless possibilities. The official details regarding season 2 of 'Red Rose' are yet to be announced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqpWZerO70p5knqaUnruoecSxp6WZmaOypXnDoptmopGurm6%2F05qprWWWpLmtu9aipaBlpJ2ybrPAq5unnaJitaa%2BxKxkoaenYsGpsYymsKyslafGbsHNn6alnKM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-did-gina-carano-tweet-that-got-her-fired-from-the-mandalorian.html><span>←</span><span>What did Gina Carano tweet that got her fired from The Mandalorian?</span></a>
