Miranda (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nicole Anderson</strong></a>) was the victim of last week’s skid-and-sink, but I guess that’s only fair since&nbsp;she‘s the one who grabbed the wheel from Remy (<strong>Britne Oldford</strong>) to avoid the ghost lady she saw standing in the middle of the road.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>(And who’s the ghost now, Miranda?! That’s right,&nbsp;you&nbsp;are.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>I’m not sure about the logistics of what happened next, but after reading a letter Miranda’s mother had written for her, Caleb (<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tyler Blackburn</a></strong>)&nbsp;was suddenly able to see and speak to the adorably departed. He had briefly seen her in a dream before that, but she explained it was actually a vision she planted in his head.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Then Caleb asked Miranda who the fuzz that lady was standing in the road the night of the crash, and she responded, “I don’t know, but it’s been waiting a long time … for all of us.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>(Easy, ghost girl, you’re freaking us all out!)</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Honestly, though, it must have been awkward for ghost-Miranda to see everyone’s reaction to her death. No one appeared to mourn her loss, including her creeper uncle (<strong>Steven Cabral</strong>), who seemed pretty chill while cutting her open.</p><h3>Other #RavenswoodProblems</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>>> Remy started sleepwalking this week, which will probably lead to terrible things in the future. That girl needs to wear a bell!</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>>> Did Luke (<strong>Brett Dier</strong>) and Olivia’s (<strong>Merritt Patterson</strong>) mom cheat on their dad? And then kill him? I don’t think we have enough info. to start theorizing, but I’m definitely intrigued!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>>> The police in Ravenswood seem far more trustworthy than the ones in Rosewood — even if they aren’t nearly as attractive.</p><h3>WATCH: <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Tyler Blackburn Talks Hanna, Baths & Ghosts</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what did you think of episode two?
