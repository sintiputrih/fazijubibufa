He rapidly turned the team around, leading them to the NFC championship and then to Super Bowl 47 in 2012-13.</p><p>After another successful season, the 49ers’ performance declined due to injuries and management conflicts, so Harbaugh left to become the new head coach at the University of Michigan in 2015.
