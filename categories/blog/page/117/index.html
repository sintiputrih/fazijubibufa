Explore More Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis has been one of the most scrutinized owners in the NFL over the years – and his haircut hasn’t helped. Davis’ hair, which can be described as a loosely-stitched together combination of a bowl cut and the male version of bangs, has been a punchline on social media and NFL circles.
