<a href=../../../../the-2011-macbook-air-11-13inch-review.html></a>
A New Boot Camp One thing that always bothered me about the 2010 MacBook Air was while Apple gave you a USB stick with OS X on it, you still needed to use an external optical drive to install Windows. By default Boot Camp wouldn't let you install Windows 7 off of a USB stick or external USB hard drive. Of course with some extra work you could do this on your own, but it's something that Apple should've made easier from the start.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/52/>← Prev Page</a>
