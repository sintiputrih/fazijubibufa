Similarly, the whole family is Independent Baptist Christians.</p><h2>The Impressive Net Worth of Jim Duggar</h2><p>As of early July 2020, Jim Bob<strong> </strong>Duggar has accumulated the whopping net worth of<strong> $3.5 million</strong>.&nbsp;He credits most of her fortune to his successful career of working as a politician, real estate agent, and television personality.</p><p>As per his salary, Jim makes in the range from<strong> $25,000</strong> to<strong> $45,000 </strong>per episode as the primary payee for Counting On. In addition, he is a certified realtor who owns several commercial properties in his local area. Not just real estate, but he was also known as the seat of the US Senate in 2008.</p><p>So, Duggar has secured a substantial amount as deputy leader of the House Corrections and criminal law Sub-Committee. In fact, he and his wife endorsed Mike Huckabee, a former governor in his 2008 Republican presidential election campaign.</p><p>More to that, the couple endorsed the former Republican United States Senator <strong>Rick Santorum</strong>, in January 2012.
