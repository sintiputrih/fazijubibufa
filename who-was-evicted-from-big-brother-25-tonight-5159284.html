This season’s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>houseguests</a> constantly strategized and turned on their alliances all the way leading up to the finale on November 9. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jag Bains</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Matt Klotz</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bowie Jane</strong></a> are the last three houseguests standing — but only one can win. Big Brother‘s motto is “expect the unexpected,” so truly anything can happen during the finale.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Heading into the finale, 13 players have been evicted for good and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>another was expelled</a> for saying a racial slur. Here’s who has been sent home from Big Brother 25&nbsp;so far.</p><h2>Luke Valentine</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/big-brother-evictions-luke-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Luke Valentine</a>&nbsp;</strong>was the first houseguest to be eliminated from&nbsp;Big Brother 25. Luke, a 30-year-old illustrator from Florida, was expelled from the show for using a racial slur on the live feeds. He used the N-word in a conversation with some of the houseguests. CBS released a statement to <strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>confirming Luke’s Aug. 9. expulsion.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Luke violated the BIG BROTHER code of conduct and there is zero tolerance in the house for using a racial slur. He has been removed from the house,” the statement read. <span>Luke’s removal from the game was shown on the Aug. 10 episode.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Kirsten Elwin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/big-brother-evictions-kirsten-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>After Luke was expelled, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kirsten Elwin </strong></a>became&nbsp;the first Big Brother 25 houseguest to be evicted. Kirsten, a 25-year-old molecular biologist from Texas, was one of four people nominated for eviction on premiere night after losing a competition. Kirsten sat next to&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Felicia Cannon</a>&nbsp;</strong>on the block on eviction night. She was sent home by a unanimous 13-0 vote on the Aug. 10 episode.</p><h2>Reilly Smedley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/big-brother-evictions-reilly-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Reilly Smedley</a>&nbsp;</strong>was the second houseguest evicted from&nbsp;Big Brother 25. Reilly, a 24-year-old bartender from Nashville, won the first Head of Household competition and she got her target, Kirsten, out of the game. However, the following week Reilly was nominated for eviction by <strong>Hisam Goueli</strong>, who was a member of the opposing alliance. Reilly was evicted 12-0 over <strong>Cameron Hardin</strong> on the Aug. 17 episode.</p><h2>Hisam Goueli</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/big-brother-evictions-hisam-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Hisam Goueli was the third houseguest evicted from Big Brother 25. Hisam, a 45-year-old geriatric physician from Seattle, was backdoored during week three by his ally Felicia Cannon. Hisam rubbed a lot of people the wrong way when he was HOH, so his allies turned against him. He was evicted 11-0 over Cameron Hardin on the Aug. 24 episode.</p><h2>Red Utley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/big-brother-evictions-red-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Red Utley</strong></a> was the fourth houseguest evicted from&nbsp;Big Brother 25. Red, a 37-year-old salesman and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok star</a> from Tennessee, went home during week five at the hands of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jared Fields</strong></a>. Jared nominated Red and his closest ally Cameron, but Cameron won the Power of Veto and saved himself. Jared put&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jag Bains </strong></a>on the block as the next target, but the ultimately vote flipped against Red. Red was evicted 8-2 against Jag on the Sept. 7 episode.</p><h2>Izzy<strong>&nbsp;Gleicher</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/big-brother-izzy-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>Izzy Gleicher </strong>was sent home from Big Brother 25&nbsp;during the September 14 episode. Izzy, a 32-year-old professional flutist, ended up on the block with her ally Felicia after Cameron came into power. The vote seemed locked for Izzy to stay — until some of the houseguests decided to flip the script. When it was all said and done,<strong> Cirie Fields&nbsp;</strong>cast the one single vote for Izzy to stay at the live eviction. The vicious 8-1 vote left Izzy out in the cold, and out of luck!</p><h2>Jared Fields</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/big-brother-jared-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>Jared followed Cameron as second person sent out of the house during the Double Eviction on Sept. 21. Cirie’s son paid the price for his messy gameplay and his big fight with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cory Wurtenberger</strong></a>, who ended up being the person responsible for sending Jared home. After Jared was evicted, he and Cameron were told they will go back into the house for a week, and one of their games will be “resurrected.” Cameron beat Jared in a competition to get back into the game on the Sept. 28 episode, sending Jared home for good.</p><h2>Mecole Hayes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/big-brother-mecole-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>Mecole Hayes&nbsp;</strong>was evicted week nine and just missed out on making the jury. The 30-year-old political consultant was nominated next to her closest ally, Felicia, by HOH Cameron. Initially, Felicia was the clear target for the house. But Mecole’s quiet gameplay concerned the other houseguests who plotted her demise. On the October 5 eviction episode, Mecole was voted out unanimously.</p><h2>Cameron Hardin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/big-brother-cameron-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>Cameron Hardin was evicted for the second time on the October 12 episode of Big Brother 25. After returning to the game thanks to the “Zombie” twist, and then winning both HOH and Veto, the house united to eliminate Cameron for good. He was shocked when <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bowie Jane</strong></a>, someone he thought he had a strong alliance with, backdoored him. Cameron was evicted unanimously by his houseguests and became the first member of the seven-person jury.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Cory Wurtenberger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/big-brother-cory-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>Cory Wurtenberger was evicted week 11 and became the second member of the jury. Cory and his showmance <strong>America Lopez</strong> were completely blindsided by their ally Jag when he put them both on the block. Cory tried campaigning to stay, but it didn’t work, and he was evicted unanimously on October 19.</p><h2>Blue Kim</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/blue-big-brother-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong>Blue Kim</strong> was the first houseguest evicted during the second double eviction of the season on October 26. Blue was nominated by her ally Jag and thought she was the pawn against America. But Blue was the target all along — the house decided to unanimously vote her out and make her the third member of the jury.</p><h2>America Lopez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/big-brother-america-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>America was the second houseguest evicted during the second double eviction of the season on October 26. America survived the first vote of the night against Blue, but she wasn’t so lucky after Bowie won HOH and then Matt won the Veto. America was evicted 3-0 against Felicia and became the fourth member of the jury.</p><h2>Cirie Fields</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/big-brother-cirie-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-17>After running the game for the first half of BB25, and then fighting from the bottom during the second half, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cirie Fields</strong></a> was evicted in fifth place on November 2. The four-time&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Survivor</a>&nbsp;player lasted 93 days in the house and made it much further than her son, Jared. Cirie became the fifth member of the jury when she was sent home.</p><h2>Felicia Cannon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/big-brother-felicia-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>Felicia Cannon survived the block seven times before she was evicted in fourth place on November 5. Felicia was the underdog for the second half of the game, but ultimately she couldn’t break up the majority alliance of Jag, Matt, and Bowie to survive any longer. Felicia became the sixth member of the jury when she was sent home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmavkah6psLInKuenF2bv7C5jJugoGWSp7y1tMSrZGttXam8r7XGoatmbWFqhnOEk2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ari-fletcher-twerking-video.html><span>←</span><span>WATCH: Ari Fletcher twerking Video Goes viral on Moneybagg Yo Instagram</span></a>
