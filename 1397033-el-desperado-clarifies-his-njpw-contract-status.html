Desperado has had a successful tenure with NJPW. He is a two-time IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion and a four-time IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champion. Desperado has also held the NEVER Openweight Six-Man Tag Team Championship. He has competed outside of NJPW in recent months, as he has wrestled for GCW and other promotions.
