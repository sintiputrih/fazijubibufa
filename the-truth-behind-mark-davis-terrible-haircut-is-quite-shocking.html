I don’t really have to comb it,” Davis said. “It’s not [my barber’s] fault with the hair. I force her to do it.”</p><p>And Gruden said that he shares a similar hair-care technique.</p><p>“We have the same hairstyle, so we got that going for us,” Gruden said. “We just get it dry and let it fly.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/jon-gruden-mark-davis.jpg><p>Gruden’s staunch defense aside, Davis admitted during the segment that he is able to take the jokes about his hair lightly and is often able to make fun of himself.</p><p>“People ask me where I grew up, and I say, ‘I haven’t,’” Davis said.</p><p>Davis and Gruden are leading the Raiders through their second season in Las Vegas, and the first in which fans are allowed to attend games at the newly constructed Allegiant Stadium.</p><p>The <a href=#>team is off to a 2-0 start</a> for the second consecutive year in its new city.
