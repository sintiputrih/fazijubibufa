We’d go back and shoot all the historical scenes and just before a moment that everyone recognizes, there’s Joey and Phoebe coming out of a broom closet together. But they were like, ‘Nah."</p><p>It could've made quite the moment, and given that it wouldn't be serious, it may have worked out for the better.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though the show creators chose to make their paths separate towards the end, and turn Joey into more of a father figure alongside Pheobe, like at her wedding.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Sitcom Star Thought He Landed A Career Changing Role On 'Friends'</a></span></p><p>Off the set, the two were just as close.

The time when Phoebe was the best friend anyone could ever have."</p><p>"Without them, F.R.I.E.N.D.S would become all flooooppyy."</p><p>The popular opinion is that everyone getting together would've been too much. Though fans believe that if there was a relationship that made the most sense on paper, it was Joey and Pheobe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I personally believe out of all the possible pairings that could've been made within the group, Joey and Phoebe are the best. I will, of course, justify my opinion."</p><p>Fans suggest that they had a stronger connection, given that they didn't know the group in high school. Also factor in their silly ways, along with never beefing with anyone in the group.</p><p>Maybe the theme on the show was "opposites attract", according to one of the Quora users and for that reason, the two didn't share a romantic relationship.</p><p>We can all agree, imagining the pair together is interesting, though it all worked out for the best.</p><p>Some fans might argue that they would've rather seen Phoebe end up with David, though that's a topic of conversation for another time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Joey, given his history on the show, it only made sense that it ended while he had no serious love interest.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Perry Admits He Felt Like He 'Was Going To Die' When Filming Friends</a></span></p><p>Sources: Quora, EW, Twitter, and Bustle</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYsGptc2kZK2gmah6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZaKarrS7zWauobFdn7ymxYyapZ1loJ28pq7EZqWerpWneqi702arqJ%2BVqbWmvoyopWaeop6yr7DSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./delina-hillock.html><span>←</span><span>Delina Hillock Net Worth, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</span></a>
