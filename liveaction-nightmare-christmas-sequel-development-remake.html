Now, sources close to We Got This Covered – the same ones who told us <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an&nbsp;Aladdin&nbsp;sequel was in development</a> before it was later confirmed – have informed us that the project is still in the works and is definitely happening.</p><p data-characters=609 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>From what we understand, this new take will be a reboot/sequel to the first film – kind of like The Suicide Squad – so not necessarily a straight-up remake like most of Disney’s productions in this regard. However, it’ll still be “faithful” to the Henry Selick-directed effort, so take that how you will. Despite the live-action label we’re hearing is attached to it, I’d still speculate that it’ll be mostly CGI, given the kooky nature of the characters. Jack Skellington would really lose something if he was just a guy in a suit and make-up, after all.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas-3D-Poster-564x282.jpg alt=The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas-3D-Poster width=564 height=282 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>Tim Burton – who conceived of the story and the characters – is known to be against the idea of doing more&nbsp;Nightmare&nbsp;movies, but it’s possible that he’s changed his mind of late or he simply doesn’t have enough say in the matter to keep Disney from doing it. Jack voice actor Chris Sarandon, meanwhile, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">would love a sequel</a>, but it’s unknown at this stage whether any of the original cast would return.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>What do you think, though?
