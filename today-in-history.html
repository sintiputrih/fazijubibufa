The delegates had voted to approve the motion of independence from Great Britain two days earlier, on July 2, and most would not actually sign the document until August 2. Nevertheless, July 4 is celebrated as “Independence Day” in the United States.</p><h2>1826: Thomas Jefferson And John Adams Die</h2><p>Founding Fathers Thomas Jefferson and John Adams die within hours of each other. Adams, the United States’ second president, and Jefferson, the nation’s third, had each played a crucial role in the country’s path to independence. Though they’d had a political falling out, the two men reconciled after their respective presidencies, and Adams’ last words were, “Thomas Jefferson still survives!” though, unbeknownst to him, Jefferson had already passed away.</p><h2>1831: James Monroe Dies</h2><p>Five years after Thomas Jefferson and John Adams’s death, their fellow Founding father and former president James Monroe dies at the age of 73.</p><h2>1857: The Dead Rabbits And Bowery Boys Riot In Lower Manhattan</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-381500 alt="Bowery Boy" width=900 height=617 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/bowery-boy.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-381500 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A depiction of a stereotypical Bowery Boy.</span></p><p>The infamous gangs known as the <a href=# rel=noopener>Dead Rabbits</a> and the <a href=# rel=noopener>Bowery Boys</a> fight in New York City. As depicted in Gangs of New York, the Dead Rabbits were an Irish immigrant gang, whereas the Bowery Boys consisted of anti-immigrant Americans. They came to blows over a plot of land called Paradise Square, and the subsequent riot had to be quelled by the New York State Militia.</p><h2>1884: France Gifts The Statue Of Liberty To The United States</h2><p>France gifts the <a href=# rel=noopener>Statue of Liberty</a> to the United States to commemorate the American-French alliance during the American Revolution. In 1865, Edouard de Laboulaye proposed the creation of the statue to honor ideas of freedom and liberty. Sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi drafted an idea for the statue in 1870.</p><p>Fourteen years later, the statue was complete and presented to the American ambassador in Paris. The statue was disassembled and sent to New York City where it stands in the New York Harbor today.</p><h2>1995: Bob Ross Dies</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-329890 alt="Bob Ross" width=900 height=636 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/bob-ross-final-episode-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-329890 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>YouTube</span><span class=caption-body>Bob Ross was suffering from lymphoma during his final televised appearance.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Bob Ross dies</a> of lymphoma in Florida at the age of 52.
