When we decided to get married, I told my dad that we’d like it small. I was quite surprised that he actually agreed. In fact, they had zeroed in on March 17, 2014 (Monday), to sign the papers. But since we thought that the court would be buzzing with activity on a Monday, we decided to go ahead instead of on what people generally consider unlucky, a Tuesday.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Other_Relatives></span><strong>Other Relatives</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kej’s maternal grandfather, Janaki Das Mehra, was an Indian actor, Olympic cyclist, and freedom fighter.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ricky-Kejs-maternal-grandfather.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-97548 class=wp-caption-text>Ricky Kej’s maternal grandfather</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=AffairsGirlfriends></span>Affairs/Girlfriends<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ricky met Varsha in the year, 2006, for the first time.

He said,<br><p>Making jingles is like a workout. One day, I get to work on a Tamil folk jingle and the next day I get to work on a Celtic jingle and an Oriental jingle on the third day. It keeps you on your toes and helps you extend your creativity. The more I work on jingles the better I get at working with new people.”</p></li></ul><ul><li>In 2010, Kej was nominated for an award at the Cannes Film Festival for his jingle on Nike.

His father said,<br><p>I have seen him really struggle. He bought a second-hand guitar from his own pocket money and learnt it without anyone’s help. I did not give him any money, yet he built his studio. I used to feel sorry for him carrying big instruments while he was a very small boy.”</p><p>His mother added,</p><p>We did not help him in any way in his pursuit of music. He is a self-made man who started from scratch.”</p></li></ul><ul><li>During a media interaction in 2015, when Kej’s father was asked about his son’s Grammy win, he said,<br><p>I am extremely proud of him.

He further said that it was nothing less of a privilege for him to have worked with Copeland. He said,<br><p>I have grown up listening to his music and his music has shaped my entire life (when it comes to my musical career) and to have this privilege to create an album with him and to actually win a Grammy along with him on the same stage has been quite a surreal experience.”</p></li></ul><ul><li>The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to Twitter to congratulate Kej on his victory, he wrote,<br><p>Congratulations for this remarkable feat and best wishes for your future endeavours!”</p><p>Amazed by Modi’s wishes, Ricky replied,</p><p>Wow.. speechless!

You set me on the path of Environmental Consciousness 7 years ago when I won my 1st GRAMMY Award, and here I am today 🙂 Thanks for your blessings.”</p></li></ul><ul><li>Kej has been vocal about piracy affecting the artists in India. In an interview, he said that very little was done in India for the protection of intellectual property rights which resulted in uncontrolled illegal downloading of music and films. Suggesting ways to curb it, Ricky said,<br><p>I think two things need to be done – the anti-piracy laws that exist need to be enforced very strongly and awareness needs to be created that piracy is not a victimless crime. The victim is the artiste.”</p></li></ul><h3>Related posts:</h3><a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Reena Rai Wiki, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Reena Rai Wiki, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Cheslie Kryst Wiki, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Death, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Cheslie Kryst Wiki, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Death, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Anna Ben Wiki, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Husband, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Anna Ben Wiki, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Husband, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Trishala Dutt Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Trishala Dutt Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamZy7ornEm6CoZpOkunC%2ByJyismWbmrdw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-parker-cause-of-death.html><span>←</span><span>Mud Rider Died After Accident</span></a>
