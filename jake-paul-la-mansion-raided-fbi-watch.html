The YouTube star essentially reiterated what the bureau already said was the purpose of the search (see that statement below). In a video, Jake announced, “Just to clarify things and set the record straight, the FBI raid is entirely related to the Arizona looting situation that had happened, and it is an investigation. There are rumors about it having to do with so many other things that have nothing to do with me or my character. And the s–t that people are making up is absolutely absurd.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“But with that being said, when I become aware of someone around me who that is doing malicious things, they are immediately cut out of my life…I don’t put up with bulls–t, I don’t surround myself with bad people,” Jake continued. He revealed that he’s now just trying to focus on boxing, music and himself, and confirmed that his boxing match against NBA star <strong>Nate Robinson</strong> has been moved from Sept. 12 to Nov. 28.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-4></p></a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Damn son – #jakepaul</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TheBreadBatch</a> (@thebreadbatch) on Aug 12, 2020 at 11:36am PDT</p><p id=content-paragraph-5></p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>UPDATE (8/5/20, 6:10 PM ET):</strong> The FBI has confirmed they executed a federal search warrant in connection with an ongoing investigation via a statement. “The FBI is investigating allegations of criminal acts surrounding the incident at Scottsdale Fashion Square in May, 2020,” a statement obtained by <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> read. “This morning the FBI executed federal search warrants in California and Las Vegas, Nevada in connection with this investigation. The search warrant affidavits are sealed and we are, therefore, prohibited from commenting further,” it also said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The Scottsdale Police Department has also issued a statement. “Misdemeanor charges for Jake Paul, Arman Izadi and Andrew Leon related to their involvement in the May 30, 2020 Scottsdale Fashion Square riots are being dismissed without prejudice today,” they said in a second statement, also obtained by&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. “The Scottsdale Police Department and Scottsdale City Attorney’s Office are coordinating with the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona and the FBI to ensure that justice is served regarding criminal acts at Scottsdale Fashion Square on May 30,2020.

Scottsdale retains the option to refile charges depending on the outcome of the federal investigation,” the statement read.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>UPDATE (8/5/20, 4:15 PM ET</strong><strong>)</strong>: <strong>Richard Schonfeld</strong>, Jake Paul’s attorney, shared a statement regarding the raid. “We understand that a search warrant was executed at Jake’s Calabasas home this morning while Jake was out-of-state. We are still gathering information and will cooperate with the investigation,” he told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>ORIGINAL</strong>: <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jake Paul</strong></a>‘s LA mansion has been searched by the FBI in an early morning raid conducted on August 5. “The affidavit in support of the search warrant is sealed and we are, therefore, prohibited from commenting as to the nature of the investigation,” the bureau shared in a statement to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ABC</a><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> 7</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>HollywoodLife</strong> confirmed the raid with a statement from the FBI. “The FBI has executed a federal search warrant in connection with an ongoing investigation.

The outlet also noted that a number of “armored trucks” were seen leaving Jake’s Calabasas home following the raid. Jake’s YouTube stunts, actions, and feuds in which he has been involved have <a href=#>raised questions</a> in the past.<p id=content-paragraph-12>The raid comes roughly two weeks after a party was thrown at Jake’s home. The mayor of Calabasas, <strong>Alicia Weintraub</strong>, was outraged after seeing footage taken at the mansion, which featured party-goers neglecting safety precautions amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “I was very upset that somebody would hold such an outrageous gathering in our community,” the mayor shared with ABC News. “We’re trying to do everything we can to get our numbers down and keep our community safe, and something like this just does the opposite.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>At the end of May, Jake also denied any wrongdoing after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filming vandalism</a> at a mall following a Black Lives Matter protest. The YouTuber denied ever being ‘engaged’ in any looting of the property. Although he was charged with trespassing, Jake <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>never served any prison time</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>As this story continues to develop, HollywoodLife will update its readership with the latest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH15e49uZqOZm5p6sa3UpWSlmV2irq%2B%2FyKilZqqRnrGmsIyfmaJlp5bBpLSO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carole-crema-net-worth-264072.html><span>←</span><span>Carole Crema Net Worth</span></a>
