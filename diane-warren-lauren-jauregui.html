Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴&nbsp;&nbsp;Line by Line Meaning ↴Look in your eyes, pulling me in, taking me down
Look at my heart, under your feet on the ground
Ask about now, can someone tell me how
I got in this position I'm in? (Oh, yeah)Why do my hands memorize every part of you?
Why do your lips move with mine like they do?"><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The song is about falling for someone and being caught off guard by the intensity of those feelings. The first verse talks about being drawn in by the other person's eyes and how the singer's heart feels vulnerable and exposed. The chorus reiterates this sentiment by saying that the singer was not prepared to fall in love with this person, how they hit her heart like a train, and that her walls have come crashing down around her. The second verse delves deeper into the singer's confusion about why she is so taken with this person and why her body seems to respond to them on a primal level.</p><br><p>The bridge furthers the idea of the singer being caught off guard by showcasing her previous resilience in the face of adversity. She has been through trying times before, but this love has left her feeling more exposed than ever before. The overall theme of the song is vulnerability and how love can tear down even the strongest defenses. It speaks to the fact that falling in love is not always a conscious choice but can happen suddenly and unexpectedly, leaving the person feeling unprepared and unsure of themselves.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Look in your eyes, pulling me in, taking me down</u><br>Your gaze is captivating and dragging me into something I may not be ready for.</p><br><p><u>Look at my heart, under your feet on the ground</u><br>My heart is now vulnerable and fragile beneath your footsteps after you've taken it from me.</p><br><p><u>Ask about now, can someone tell me how I got in this position I'm in? (Oh, yeah)</u><br>I'm questioning how I let myself be in this emotional state of being vulnerable to someone else and not even realizing it until now.</p><br><p><u>Why do my hands memorize every part of you?</u><br>My hands involuntarily remember every detail about you, even though I didn't know I was paying such close attention.</p><br><p><u>Why do your lips move with mine like they do?</u><br>Our lips moving together feels like a natural connection, despite it being new to both of us.</p><br><p><u>Thought I was so strong, but you prove me so wrong Never thought I ever see me like this</u><br>I thought I was unbreakable, but you've shown me otherwise and made me see a vulnerable side of myself that I never thought I would reveal.</p><br><p><u>Been through a tidal wave, a hurricane Been through all that and more But nothing like this before</u><br>I've been through many difficult situations, but none compare to the overwhelming feelings that you've brought up in me.</p><br><p><u>I was not prepared for you (not prepared) Not prepared for you, no (not prepared) You hit my heart like a train Damn, you just blew me away</u><br>I didn't expect to feel this overwhelmed and captivated by you, but you've hit me with such strong emotions that it's hard to keep standing.</p><br><p><u>Nothing I could do, no (nothing) I built these walls all around You burnt this shit to the ground, ground</u><br>Despite my attempts to protect myself, you've managed to tear down my emotional defenses and leave me exposed and vulnerable.</p><br><p><u>Hit me so hard, knock me right off of my feet Now I'm here left with what's left of me You're the reason my pride's ripped to pieces You're the one who brought me down to my knees</u><br>You've hit me with such intensity that I'm no longer standing on my own two feet, and all that's left is what remains of me, a person with their pride and self-assurance destroyed.</p><br><p><u>Could walk away, but not this time</u><br>I've been through tough times before and could walk away, but this time it's different because of the strong emotional attachment I have to you.</p><br><p><u>('Cause you) 'cause you tripped me up (And now) you got me giving up (Before you) I was hella tough, before you I was strong (Before you) you got the best of me (And now) you made a mess of me (Yes, you did) and it didn't take too long</u><br>You've tripped me up in a way that's made me give up fighting against the feelings that have taken over. Before you, I was confident and strong, but you got the best of me and now I'm left feeling like a mess. All of this has happened so quickly.</p><br><p><u>No, no</u><br>This small line reflects the finality of the situation, accepting that these emotions are too strong to ignore or brush off.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © BMG Rights Management<br>Written by: Diane Warren</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maHyZlrumq7aaqaudnpSZosHRnqWYgpGqv6az1KJmh6eklJ2zsc%2BaqZ6cj3u8s6u4qKw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luka-garza-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103958-html.html><span>←</span><span>Luka Garza Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
