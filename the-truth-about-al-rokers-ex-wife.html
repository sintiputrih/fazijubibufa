According to the&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Times</a>, Roker married Bell on December 22, 1984, in Peekskill, N.Y, at a private home.&nbsp;</p><p>They were married for 10 years, per <a href=#>AmoMama</a>, separating in 1992 and finalizing the divorce in 1994. Roker met Deborah Roberts in 1990 when Roberts had started working with NBC in New York, and she thought he was a nice fellow. Roberts moved to different cities, but she and Roker kept in touch, reconnecting in 1992 when she returned to his city. The <a href=#>New York Times</a> announced their wedding in September 1995.</p><p>Per their wedding announcement, Bell was the operations producer for NBC's "Live at Five" when they married in 1984. She was presumably from New York, like her mother Elizabeth Bell, and her father Calvin Bell had passed away. Alice graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles. It is unclear where Alice is working now, or if she is still alive.</p><p>Courtney is Roker's oldest daughter, at 34 years old, and she was an infant when Bell and Roker adopted her in 1987, according to <a href=#>Distractify</a>. Roberts helped raise Courtney after Roker's divorce from Bell, as well as her own two children with Roker. Roker shared a photo on <a href=#>Instagram</a> of he and Roberts with the bride and groom at the wedding, and Roberts looks delighted to be there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWthZoJye9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2WuW6%2BzqScq6tdmsVuw8ifnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sam-harris-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Sam Harris Net Worth 2024</span></a>
