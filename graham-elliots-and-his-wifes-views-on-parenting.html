There have been reports that the couple is divorcing, but nothing has been proven as of this writing.</p><h2>Allie Bowles, Graham Elliot’s Wife</h2><p>While the MasterChef judge continues to get media recognition for his on-screen profession, he maintains his personal life private. Bowles, his wife, and a mother of three are in the same boat. Bowles is presently working as an Admissions Officer at Morgan Park Academy, a small, independent school on the city’s Southside. Allie Bowles is also a yoga teacher at Warrior Mom Yoga and Barre It All Fitness, where she helps individuals improve their flexibility and core strength.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Graham-Elliot-4.jpg><p>Allie Bowles received a bachelor’s degree in hospitality management from Northern Michigan University before coming to Chicago to pursue a career in hotel and restaurant management and event planning. She became a member of Barre It All in 2016 after falling in love with the classes. Allie became a barre teacher after obtaining her certification, and the rest is history. She also serves on the honorary board of Smile Train, a non-profit cleft lip and palate organization for which she was selected “volunteer of the year” in 2019.</p><h2>Graham Elliot’s and His Wife’s Views on Parenting</h2><p>On September 18, 2010, Elliot and his wife had their first child. When Conrad entered their lives, he was overjoyed.&nbsp;From his prior marriage, the restaurateur already had a son called Mylo.&nbsp;“Mylo says he’s very pleased to have a younger brother,” Elliot said, “as long as he doesn’t mess with his toys!”&nbsp;Elliot was looking forward to spoiling Conrad with all kinds of delectable baby delicacies.&nbsp;Jedediah Lindsay Bowles, the couple’s third child, was named after both of their dads. She was born in the month of August of 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Graham-Elliot-5.jpg><p>On an important day, Elliot tweeted, “Mom/baby doing fantastic, [Jedediah’s older brothers] Mylo and Conrad are very thrilled!”&nbsp;Despite the fact that Elliot and his wife now live apart, with Elliot residing on the beach in Hawaii, the pair is still joyfully co-parenting the three sons.&nbsp;Bowles wished Elliot a happy birthday on Instagram with a snapshot of their children blowing out candles on a cake. She expresses her appreciation for the three “gifts” on the post.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Elliot is living in Oahu, Hawaii, with his dog. He only writes about his children on a regular basis and prefers to keep them out of the limelight.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGieq5mYlrpusculoKiso2Kur7CMoaCsZaees6a%2FjK%2Bgnq%2BjYryvec%2BaqZ6mpJ67qHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./drunk-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Charming Drunk Photos Show People After 1, 2, And 3 Drinks</span></a>
