A super nourishing, brightening and anti-aging moisturizer all in one for all skin types, even breakout prone skin, and what I love is how it makes my skin GLOW all day and night and looks beautiful underneath makeup.</p><p id=ez8-JbtZ5Di3 data-wc=53>I'd also recommend using<span><a aria-label="kora organics" class="aff-text hm-link" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored"> the Turmeric Brightening & Exfoliating Mask</a></span>. It’s an actual physical exfoliant and a deeply detoxifying mask in one. The peppermint aromatherapy is so invigorating for your senses and the rose hip seeds combined with the aspen bark and mineral powder deeply exfoliate your skin while the turmeric brightens and helps with dark spots and pigmentation.</p><p id=eJICtJVZFq1- data-wc=5>I’m obsessed with this product!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b0c53b0a00ed-kororganics-moisturizer-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ezor0av3pEMl data-wc=7><strong>KORA&nbsp;Organics' Turmeric Glow Brightening Moisturizer, $60</strong></p><h6 data-comp="DisplayName StyledComponent BaseComponent " style=text-align:center><span><a aria-label="KORA ORGANICS" class="product__button hm-link" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><h3>Do you use the products yourself and what is your favorite?</h3><p id=eN3FlwqHyb8c data-wc=26>Miranda: Yes!&nbsp;I use all KORA Organics products as a part of my daily routine.

I feel like a whole new person stepping out of the shower using this!</p><h3>Why did you want to move into body care?</h3><p id=ei2yaTeWbqcQ data-wc=23>Miranda: I feel it is as important to take care of our body just as much as we take care of our face.</p><p id=eq-HHYEDgBfA data-wc=63>A lot of people don't know I'm actually a certified health coach, so my genuine passion for health and wellbeing always makes me want to keep innovating KORA Organics products. Our skin is our largest organ, and what we put on our skin soaks in, which means we should avoid the use of unnecessary chemicals and choose healthy, nutrient-rich skincare for our bodies.</p><p id=evgaH-6eevFI data-wc=27>I was inspired by our best-sellers in skincare in wanting to bring certified organic ingredients and powerful results to your full body, which everyone deserves without compromise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3dbc094db0f1-koraorganics-scrub-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e3L2lhMQhFww data-wc=7><strong>KORA Organics&nbsp;Turmeric Invigorating Body Scrub, $60</strong></p><h6 style=text-align:center><span><a aria-label="kora organics" class="product__button hm-link" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><h3>What is KORA doing that is revolutionary and makes it unique in a crowded field?</h3><p id=e1neORpzDGTm data-wc=34>Miranda: KORA Organics was one of the first skincare brands to be Certified Organic, and is still one of the select few beauty brands in accordance with Ecocert/COSMOS standards, the authority in organic certification.</p><p id=eTHaiayI5t1w data-wc=18>A study from Cambridge shows certified organic ingredients are packed with 60% more antioxidants than non organic ingredients.</p><p id=ePl--AbRpsbI data-wc=30>A holistic approach to skincare is also important to us - all of our products are filtered through Rose Quartz crystals to energize the products with a loving, nurturing energy.</p><h3>Which of your friends do you rely on the most for honest feedback?</h3><p id=ej8WMdXF8DHY data-wc=19>Miranda: I probably rely on my friend Michaeline [DeJoria, the CEO of Paul Mitchell] the most for honest feedback.</p><p id=eSkmHV0G2Q_Q data-wc=22>She is also a mother of three and a CEO in the beauty industry, so we have a lot to chat about!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3065d735713d-koraorganic-lotion-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ehwAORnoNide data-wc=8><strong>KORA Organics&nbsp;Nourishing Hand & Body Lotion, $55</strong></p><h6 style=text-align:center><span><a aria-label="kora organics" class="product__button hm-link" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><h3>Thinking back to 2009 did you expect clean beauty to become the global trend it is now?</h3><p id=eUZ1pFKisXEX data-wc=40>Miranda: When I launched KORA no one was talking about clean or organic beauty and I am so proud that KORA was one of the very first global brands to pave the way in what now is a global phenomenon.</p><p id=eNABxtkbjX95 data-wc=22>I knew that eventually consumers would become much more aware and educated about ingredients in products, which is so great to see.</p><h3>How do you continue to make the brand sustainable?</h3><p id=eL_v0372D9OL data-wc=46>Miranda: As a climate neutral-certified brand, we measure and offset our carbon footprint, reduce our future carbon emissions and become more sustainable by using recycled, recyclable, refillable or biodegradable material in all packaging, reducing our air freight, electricity and gas in our offices, and replacing trees.</p><p id=eHOPZUm-PwK1 data-wc=25>We also have refillable glass jars and refill pods for several of our products to help reduce waste, and these pods can also be recycled!</p><p id=ekJB4qIxh3Fp data-wc=15>Our new body trio was made with 100% PCR packaging components to reduce environmental impact.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1ab01a2f036d-mirandakerr-kora-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eLhyTKUxM85N data-wc=8><strong>Miranda leans on her friends for honest feedback</strong></p><h3>What is next for KORA?</h3><p id=eOFnwN5sZwoc data-wc=34>Miranda: We have a couple product launches next year that I am super excited about! My focus will also be on continuing to cement our position as a leader in the clean skincare space.</p><h3>Skincare is intrinsically linked to lifestyle, what is the first change you would tell people to make to improve skin?</h3><p id=e77Iyt44J36n data-wc=33>Miranda: I truly believe health is wealth! I graduated from the Institute for Integrative Nutrition in 2010 and I also recently took a Stanford University class online about health and nutrition through Coursera.</p><p id=ezyejR0Yx8N4 data-wc=37>I am constantly expanding my knowledge on health and wellness. Healthy skin is the most beautiful skin so if you feed it the right nutrients, both internally and externally, then it will really be at its best.</p><p id=epq1JAm4q7y8 data-wc=34>My one tip would be to make sure you are getting nutrients from the foods that you eat, and celery juice every morning on an empty stomach has been a game changer for me.</p><p id=e4T0dNe0JlTc data-wc=14></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKqkoZ6YrrOxjJqlnWWWp66ovsCnmp6rX2d9c36QaWlqaWVphXqDjqagq5mema5ut8SrqWajn6eubrvRoJinoZOoerS3yKeamqqVYrK5r8uuqqKulWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deryck-whibley-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Deryck Whibley Net Worth</span></a>
