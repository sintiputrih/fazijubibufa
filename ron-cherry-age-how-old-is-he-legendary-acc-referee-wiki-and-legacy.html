<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Ron Cherry Age | How Old Is He | Legendary ACC Referee Wiki And Legacy</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Wikipedia describes Ron Cherry as a legendary former ACC referee. Ron Cherry, a well-known college football referee, just retired after a successful career lasting over 25 years.</strong></p><p>His dominant performance on the field pushed him to fame among collegiate football officials. Cherry handled numerous high-profile games, including the 2009 BCS National Championship. In 2007, he made international headlines by impersonating Ben Dreith’s famous “giving him the business” call during a personal foul pronouncement.</p><p>Despite occasional clashes, he was widely considered an excellent referee. Notably, the 2013 Fiesta Bowl showcased Cherry’s talent by spotlighting his team’s crucial call throughout the game. Beyond the pitch, Cherry was recognized for his charisma, with many describing him as the closest thing referees had to a rock star.</p><p>Cherry’s most memorable moment occurred during a 2007 game between Maryland and North Carolina State when he delivered the famous “quote of the year”: “Personal foul.” 69. Offense. He handed him the business. “Replay the down.” This call has become iconic in college football history. Despite this, Cherry’s career ended abruptly in 2016 due to an accident during a Notre Dame-USC game.</p><h2>Ron Cherry Wikipedia: Retirement, Overcoming Adversity, and Legacy</h2><p>Ron Cherry’s career took an unexpected turn at the age of 60 or 65 when he suffered a brain injury during a game between USC and Notre Dame, necessitating emergency neurosurgery. According to ESPN, despite the setback, he left politely and accepted a new position as an advisor and assistant to Dennis Hennigan, the ACC’s coordinator of officials.</p><p>Cherry spoke on the challenges, adding, “I was going to [retire] the next year anyway, but you get knocked on your ass.” Ron Cherry refereed over 300 Division I games, leaving a lasting impression.</p><p>Aside from the notable calls, he influenced a generation of officials and played a critical role in creating opportunities for Black officials. Despite being best recognized for a single call, Cherry remains humble, appreciating the diverse experiences and friendships he acquired during his extraordinary career.</p><h2>On-Field Impact: A Critical Moment in the Notre Dame-USC Game</h2><p>Ron Cherry was severely injured during the third quarter of the Notre Dame-USC game on November 26. In pursuit of a sack, USC linebacker Michael Hutchings accidentally struck Cherry with his helmet just as Cherry called the play dead. Cherry was left unconscious as a result of the incident.</p><p>Cherry was evaluated for a concussion at a Los Angeles hospital shortly after the incident. According to sources, after the assessment, medical specialists discharged him the same night for home care. His symptoms included headaches and foot weakness, prompting his admission to Gwinnett Medical Center in Lawrenceville, Georgia.</p><p>A CT scan at the medical institution revealed a blood clot that required surgery. Cherry was admitted to the neurological critical care unit following her surgical procedure. Fortunately, the medical professionals moved him to intermediate care as part of his recovery.</p><p>Cherry underwent occupational and physical therapy throughout his recovery. Cherry had a hard time. However, the medical team’s proactive steps promptly addressed his medical needs, aiding in his eventual recovery.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
