Mahmoud Abbas, known by his kunya Abu Mazen, currently serves as the President of the State of Palestine and the Palestinian National Authority. He assumed the position of Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization in 2004, took office as President of the Palestinian National Authority in January 2005, and subsequently became President of the State of Palestine in May 2005.</p><p>A lot of people have been inquiring lot about Mahmoud Abbas wife and making various research about her on the internet.</p><p>This article talks about Mahmoud Abbas wife and everything there is to know about her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mahmoud Abbas Wife: Meet Amina Abbas</h2><p>Is Mahmoud Abbas married? Yes, Mahmoud Abbas is married to his wife, Amina Abbas. She is the First Lady of Palestine.</p><p>Born on November 15, 1935, in Safed, Mandatory Palestine (now Israel), Abbas experienced the displacement of his family during the 1948 Palestine war, which led them to seek refuge in Syria. He pursued higher education and graduated from the University of Damascus with a degree in law. Later, he continued his studies at the Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, where he obtained a Candidate of Sciences degree, equivalent to a PhD. His doctoral dissertation focused on the secret relationship between Nazism and Zionism.</p><p>Abbas married Amina Abbas, and together they had three sons. Tragically, their eldest son, Mazen Abbas, passed away in 2002. Abbas has been actively involved in promoting peace and understanding between Palestinians and Israelis. He has been one of the key negotiators and signatories of various peace agreements between the two sides.</p><p>Abbas’s political career began in the mid-1950s when he became involved in underground Palestinian politics. He joined Fatah, a political party founded by Yasser Arafat, and quickly rose through the ranks. Abbas played a crucial role in advocating for dialogue and negotiations with moderate Israelis, which eventually led to the Oslo Accords in 1993. He was one of the signatories of the agreement and worked towards its implementation.</p><p>Abbas’s pragmatic approach to diplomacy and his commitment to peaceful resistance set him apart within the PLO. He served as the first prime minister of the Palestinian Authority from March to September 2003. During his term, he faced challenges from Yasser Arafat and struggled to assert his authority. Despite these obstacles, Abbas remained committed to his vision of a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p><p>In 2005, following the death of Yasser Arafat, Abbas was elected as the President of the Palestinian National Authority. He called for an end to violence and a return to peaceful resistance. However, Hamas’s victory in the 2006 legislative elections created political tensions and divisions within the Palestinian territories.</p><p>Abbas has faced numerous challenges during his presidency, including ongoing conflicts with militant groups and strained relations with Israel. He has been an advocate for Palestinian statehood and has sought international recognition and support for the Palestinian cause. In 2014, he signed an application for Palestine to join the International Criminal Court, a move seen as a diplomatic effort to address allegations of war crimes.</p><p>Throughout his career, Abbas has maintained a commitment to peaceful negotiations and a two-state solution. He has engaged in diplomatic efforts with various world leaders, including meetings with U.S. presidents such as Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden. Abbas has also called for an end to the blockade on the Gaza Strip and expressed concern for the well-being of civilians affected by conflicts.</p><p>Abbas’s leadership has been recognized at both the national and international levels, although he has faced criticism from various quarters. He has been praised for his commitment to peace but has also faced challenges and disputes within Palestinian politics. Nonetheless, Abbas continues to play a significant role in advocating for Palestinian rights and pursuing a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ghgossip.com</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqaYoaWfqrFurcGbmKxlp56zpnnMnpytZZGitq%2BtjJqZm5mjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-jackie-kennedy-cartier-watch.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian Reportedly Bought Jackie Kennedy's Watch for $380,000</span></a>
