She is involved in various charities and philanthropy and has a degree in Nursing.&nbsp;She also owns a jewelry line that benefits Ugandan communities.&nbsp;Lauren and Thomas have known each other almost their entire lives and even went to camp together.&nbsp;They dated briefly when they were 15, but the relationship didn’t last very long.&nbsp;Despite their differences, they remained best friends.</span></p><p><span>Rhett has said in an interview that the two of them almost married other people, but Lauren’s father stepped in and made Rhett realize the mistake they were both trying to make.&nbsp;Rhett then settled on Lauren after their relationship ended and the two only dated six months before tying the knot at the age of 22.</span></p><p><span>In 2017, the couple announced a new addition to their family – a daughter Willa Gray, a Ugandan national, who was adopted and brought home three months later.&nbsp;The couple’s first biological child, a daughter by Ada James, was born just three months later in August of the same year.&nbsp;The family of four lives in Nashville, Tennessee.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height Weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>Thomas Rhett stands at an average height of 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm).&nbsp;He weighs 73 kg and owes his perfectly trained body to his daily training.&nbsp;He pretends that he doesn’t like long workouts and doesn’t even have a personal trainer.&nbsp;Due to his busy schedule, he sometimes has to content himself with improvising his workouts, whether it’s walking instead of driving, or using the stairs instead of using an elevator.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Rhett’s debut album&nbsp;</span><span>It Goes This</span><span>&nbsp;Way sold 270,000 copies, the second album,&nbsp;</span><span>Tangled</span><span>&nbsp;, sold 500,000 copies, while his album&nbsp;</span><span>Life Changes</span><span>&nbsp;In Just One Week sold 94,000 copies.&nbsp;Income from his albums, singles, collaborations with other artists, and songwriting earned him a net worth of $6.5 million.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGismKS6or%2BMq5%2BerKRir6q7jLCgn51dm66utcuyZJygmaGxs7HNZp2arJiav26txp5koZ2ZnLW1ec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stars-celebrate-valentines-day-with-ignite-bash-in-l-a.html><span>←</span><span>Stars Celebrate Valentines Day With IGNITE Bash in L.A.</span></a>
