He later went to Glenville State College in Glenville, West Virginia, on a football scholarship. However, he eventually dropped out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Channing-Tatum-Seen-as-a-College-Student-2.jpg><p>“I just got tired of playing. I was only playing to keep that scholarship. I was interested in other things and missing home,” he told <a href=#>ESPN</a> in 2012. “It just seems that I have won the lottery now.”</p><p>Upon returning home to Florida, Tatum tackled several odd jobs — including stripping. “I had wanted to tell people,” he said in a 2011 <a href=#>GQ profile</a>. “I’m not ashamed of it. I don’t regret one thing. I’m not a person who hides s–t.”</p><p>Tatum was discovered as a model, but he eventually made the transition into acting when he appeared. The G.I. Joe star gained traction in the business in 2006 after working opposite <a href=#><strong>Amanda Bynes</strong></a> in She’s the Man and <a href=#>with now estranged wife</a> <a href=#><strong>Jenna Dewan</strong></a> in Step Up.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>my boyfriends mom dated Channing Tatum in high school and she found photos of them last night</p><p>shook <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cIcSnmeJsn</a></p><p>— fath (@faiitthh33) <a href=#>September 23, 2019</a></p><p>He’s since appeared in several box office hits, from 21 Jump Street to The Vow. He’s additionally dabbled in producing projects, like Magic Mike XXL and Logan Lucky.</p><p>News of Tatum’s high school pics going viral come on the heels of <a href=#>Us Weekly confirming Dewan, 38, is expecting her first child</a> with <a href=#>her boyfriend, <strong>Steve Kazee</strong></a>, on Tuesday, September 24.

In the sweet pic, she is shown sleeping with Everly. It also shows a glimpse of the actress’ baby bump.</p><p>“Becoming a mother is quite simply the absolute best most incredible thing that has ever happened to me,” she wrote on Instagram, before praising her beau. “@stevekazee you are a <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> from above and I couldn’t be more excited to be expanding our family together…!
