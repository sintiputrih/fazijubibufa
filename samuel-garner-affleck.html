But some of them get famous worldwide without doing anything. Today we are talking about Samuel Garner Affleck is famous as the son of famous American actor Ben Affleck.</i></p><h2>Son of Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck</h2><p>Actor<strong> Jennifer Garner </strong>and director <strong>Ben Affleck</strong>&nbsp;share an adorable kid named <strong>Samuel Garner Affleck</strong>. Although the couple is no more together, they spend so much time together with their three kids.&nbsp;</p><p>Samuel Garner Affleck was born in California, the United States of America on <i>February 27, 2012</i>. Likewise, he has two older sisters named <a href=#><strong>Violet Affleck</strong></a><strong> </strong>and <a href=#><strong>Seraphina Affleck</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As said before, his father is Ben Affleck who is popular American director and his mother Jennifer Garner is an actress. Samuel parents are very conscious when it comes to his safety and personal details, so there are no details about his early life and childhood.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com:8070/uploads/biography/2019/8/26/Capture-1566814177796.jpg><h2>Education</h2><p>Samuel is just seven years old kid who is currently pursuing his studies. Affleck might be in his primary level as for now.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, he is not old enough to get engaged in any kind of career-orientated thing. However, his parents are very successful in their respective field.&nbsp;</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>As we all know, seven years old has barely seen a world to get involved in any kind of relationship or have a personal life. Yet his parents were one of the hottest couples of the entertainment industry.</p><h2>Son of Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck Relationship</h2><p>His mother Jennifer was previously married to <strong>Scott Foley </strong>before meeting his father. The pair tied a knot and were in a loving relationship for around four years. After her split with Scott Jennifer found love in the form of Ben.&nbsp;</p><p>After dating for quite a while, the pair decided to <a href=#>tie a knot</a> in 2005. The couple shared three children together. They spent thirteen years together, and at the end of 2015, the pair started having problems with each other. As per the speculation, Ben's alcohol addiction was the reason for couple's split.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com:8070/uploads/biography/2019/8/26/Capture%20(1)-1566814187632.jpg><p>Despite their separation, both the couple have decided to co-parent their three children in a mutual understanding. Unlike any other couple who have a great deal of problem raising children after the divorce so far, Ben and Jennifer are doing a great job in parenting.&nbsp;</p><p>In lots of occasions both of them go on a vacation with children. They make sure that their children do not think otherwise about their parenting.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple also appeared together to watch the their seven-year-old son Samuel compete at the little league baseball game Santa Monica, CA on May 26.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com:8070/uploads/biography/2019/8/26/Capture%20(2)-1566814216448.jpg><p>The most interesting fact is, the former pair have already moved on with their life with another partner but are very understanding when it comes to their children.&nbsp;</p><p>Samuel's mother Jennifer is currently dating <strong>John Miller</strong>. Likewise, Ben Affleck is also in an on and off relationship with SNL' producer <strong>Lindsay Shookus</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary&nbsp;</h2><p>Being seven year old young boy, Samuel is yet to choose his career pathway and flourish in it. Currently, he rejoices the wealth of his parents like other celebrity kids.</p><p>On the other hand, his father Ben Affleck has a staggering net worth of around <strong>$130 million</strong>. In the same way, his mother Jennifer Garner has a net worth around <strong>$60 million</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqyYpq2VoXqordGnnKtlkZuzrbHCpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./megan-mccarty-7099407.html><span>←</span><span>Megan McCarty - InStyle</span></a>
