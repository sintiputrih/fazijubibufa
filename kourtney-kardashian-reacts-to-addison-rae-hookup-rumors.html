Nobody judges,” the Talentless designer, 37, said.</p><p>Khloé, 36, explained the interrogation in the same clip. “We all decided to get to the bottom of Kourtney and Addison,”&nbsp;she said in a confessional. “So, we invited Addison over for lunch but without Kourtney, because we just wanna ask a couple questions and get to know her more.”</p><p>In a <a href=#>separate preview for Thursday’s episode</a>, Kim asked Kourtney’s 11-year-old son, <a href=#>Mason</a>, another question about his mom and her friend: Whose bed does the Louisiana native sleep in when she stays over?</p><p>“My mom’s,” Mason told his aunt, after which Kim noted that her older sister is “not really like this with her other girlfriends.”</p><p>Since the women became friends, people outside the Kardashian-Jenner family have <a href=#>also questioned their bond</a>.</p><p>“She’s 41 and she’s hanging around with 19 year olds in swimming pools,” one Instagram user commented on a photo of the pair in September 2020. The mother of three clapped back quickly. “Do you suggest a better place. I’m looking for ideas,” she wrote at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kourtney-Kardashian-Reacts-to-Addison-Rae-Hookup-Rumors-Curiosity-Killed-the-Cat-Inline.jpg><p>Rae, for her part, has made it clear that she <a href=#>isn’t bothered</a> by her 20-plus year age gap with the Kourtney and Kim Take Miami star.</p><p>“I feel like friendships can range from any age and I feel like everyone can relate to people in different ways,” she told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> later the same month. “Kourtney and I just&nbsp;happen to have a great friendship, which is really fun.”</p><p>Keeping Up With the Kardashians airs on E!
