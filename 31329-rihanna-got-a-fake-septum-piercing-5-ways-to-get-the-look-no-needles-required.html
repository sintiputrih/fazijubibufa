<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Rihanna Got A Fake Septum Piercing 5 Ways to Get the Look, No Needles Required</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The media got excited when <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Rihanna debuted a septum piercing</a> at her brother's album release party earlier this week, and although <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the piercing turned out to be fake</a>, I'm still pretty into the style statement. Why? Because this is a rare Rihanna signature that many less daring souls would probably be willing to try. I mean, you have to be a particularly brave individual to wear <a href=# class=T3D>a sheer dress</a> on a night out, but a fake septum piercing? NBD.</p><p>I'm a big fan of false piercings for two reasons: Because I have a metal sensitivity that prevents me from getting pierced for real and because they're an easy way to look really badass without having to endure the pain of the piercing gun (also, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>please avoid piercing guns</a> in general). I've actually been wearing ear cuffs since I was a little kid when I would buy them at <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Claire's</a>, but as you can see from Rihanna's look, fake piercings have only gotten more sophisticated since the early '00s.</p><p>Ear cuffs, fake nose rings, and all kinds of variations on the theme are hot right now. You can find them at different price points and they're carried by tons of stores and online retailers. Rihanna's fake septum piercing is from jewelry brand Meadowlark and will be available as both a clip on and a real piercing come September. You can currently <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>pre-order the piece on the Meadowlark website</a>.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Don't have the patience to wait? There are so many amazing fake piercings out there, some of them dirt cheap! Here are just five of my favorite picks from around the web.</p><h3>1. Tragus</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>This <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>tragus clip-on earring</a> is so realistic that you'll have to hide it from your mom along with those skull-printed band t-shirts you bought from Hot Topic. Plus this one is super inexpensive so you have nothing (okay, you have six dollars) to lose (Etsy, $6).</p><h3>2. Gatsby Cuff</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>Skip the drop earrings — you know what you're wearing to Jay Gatsby's next party. This <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Deco-inspired cuff</a> would look right at home on West Egg, Long Island... if that were, you know, a real place (Urban Outfitters, $18).</p><h3>3. Twisted Septum</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>This <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>false septum piercing</a> might prompt a few people to indicate you should blow your nose, but the elegant twisted design means this is subtle way to rock the look. Think of it as your training wheels before you buy that one Rihanna wore (Etsy, $9).</p><h3>4. Ear Hanger</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>Not only do you feel badass while wearing an <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>ear hanger</a>, you have the benefit of confusing people who want to know why your earring is cascading down <i>behind </i>your earlobe. Definitely a conversation piece (Free People, $29.95).</p><h3>5. Big Dipper Ear Pin</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>The ear pin is one of the most unique ways to go piercing free and look like you're sporting something complex. I love the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Big Dipper design</a> on this one from Etsy (Etsy, $19).</p><p><i>Images: <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>meadowlarkjewellry</a>/Instagram, Etsy (3), Urban Outfitters, Free People</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx0fZJrcGaqmZ2ur7rAZp6orF2Weqetyp5krJ2gqcKuec%2BinKubmaO0boGMsJiyq12pvG6zxK1kraCVYrmwu8pmpahlnpqypbjErGSrnaGqtrOxww%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./game-day.html><span>←</span><span>Healthier Game Day Recipes</span></a>
