I’ll miss you bumping along with me. Never in a million years did I think we would do this together but it’s been that much more special because of it. God is so great!! He had His plan all along! I love you little mama love big mama.”</p><p>As previously reported, Jenner, 20, who never publicly confirmed that she was pregnant, took to Instagram on Sunday to reveal that she’d welcomed a “beautiful and healthy” baby girl — <a href=#>her first child</a> with rapper boyfriend<a href=#><strong> Travis Scott</strong></a> — on Thursday, February 1.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jenner also <a href=#>shared an 11-minute YouTube video</a> that documented the past nine months. The video, which showed her growing baby bump, her food cravings, doctors appointments with Scott and her baby shower, also featured a cute moment between Jenner and Kardashian where they touched baby bumps while both wearing black sports bras and leggings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/khloe-kylie-bumps.jpg><p>The Lip Kit maven announced her baby’s arrival with a social media post on Sunday, writing, “I’m sorry for keeping you in the dark through all the assumptions. I understand you’re used to me bringing you along on all my journeys. my pregnancy was one I chose not to do in front of the world. I knew for myself i needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress free, and healthy way i knew how. there was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal i had planned. I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.”</p><p>“pregnancy has been the most beautiful, empowering, and life changing experience I’ve had in m entire life and I’m actually going to miss it,” she continued. “I appreciate my friends and especially my family for helping me make this special moment as private as we could. my beautiful and healthy baby girl arrived February 1st and i just couldn’t wait to share this blessing. I’ve never felt love and happiness like this i could burst! Thank you for understanding.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602aioaSfmnqsrdGdmKygmZa7br%2FHmqmeq12XrqPFjJuspqhdpbakedaiq6Flm665qrGMo5ynppWnfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lindsay-hubbards-bachelorette-hotel-room-number-matched-wedding-date.html><span>←</span><span>Lindsay Hubbard's Bachelorette Hotel Room Number Matched Wedding Date</span></a>
