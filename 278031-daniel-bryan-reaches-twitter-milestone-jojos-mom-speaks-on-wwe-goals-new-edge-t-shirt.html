Let me let you in on something – after filming the first 8 episodes of Total Divas, her and Eva Marie went back to training at NXT from 9 to 5 on a daily basis. She was ecstatic about all the moves she was learning from Sara Del Rey, then the news came that Total Divas was picked up for 6 more episodes and while she was happy for the extension of the show, she was also disappointed for the interruption of her daily training!! Yes she has expressed to us how much she loves the Ring and how she would love to someday/some year earn the Championship Belt!! She just turned 19… Stay tuned!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfpZxZ2xpXZmur7XEpWSbqqmWu26%2BxJqaoZ2jYsG4tdOtnKtlnZ65pr%2FTqKWeZZqkt7C%2FjKampmWjpbKit9Jmpqdlp6yybrPOmqOsZZ6axG6xw6CcZqxdqLWqvtM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alice-allison-dunnigan.html><span>←</span><span>Alice Allison Dunnigan Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
