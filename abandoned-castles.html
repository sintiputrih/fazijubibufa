It was taken over twice by the English during the Middle Ages and later pillaged during the French Revolution.</p><p>Finally, in 1809, the dilapidated castle was bought by François Hennecart, a wealthy French businessman who restored the building to its former glory and developed a splendid vineyard on its grounds. The Château de la Mothe-Chandeniers was passed on to Hennecart’s descendants until it was inherited by Baron Edgard Lejeune.</p><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <span class=caption-body>Château de la Mothe-Chandeniers was originally owned by the Bauçay family who had close ties to the French king.</span><span class=credit>Guillaume Souvant/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>The Château became famous under the ownership of Baron Edgard Lejeune, who lived and threw lavish parties there. </span><span class=credit>Guillaume Souvant/AFP via Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>One of the most distinct features of Château de la Mothe-Chandeniers is the giant moat that encircles it.</span><span class=credit>cmchandeniers/Instagram</span> <span class=caption-body>The estate stretches across 2.5 acres of land and is about 800 years old.</span><span class=credit>cmchandeniers/Instagram</span> <span class=credit>cmchandeniers/Instagram</span> <span class=caption-body>In 1932, the estate was ravaged by a fire, which cost several million francs in damages.</span><span class=credit>cmchandeniers/Instagram</span> <span class=credit>cmchandeniers/Instagram</span> <span class=caption-body>The old Château had endured so much devastation that it became too expensive to maintain.
