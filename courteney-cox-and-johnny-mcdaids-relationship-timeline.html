There is “no zoom intimacy,” she told <a href=#><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a> in June 2021.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>That being said, the entertainers definitely make the most of their time together.</p><p>Scroll down to see Cox and McDaid’s romance through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksLDB0a2cp52pYrCwxIyapZ1lmqS1r7rYZqScnJGesbR50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZK2hnZq5qrrEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pat-warren-died.html><span>←</span><span>A Beacon of WJZ tv baltimore journalism passes away after a brief illness</span></a>
