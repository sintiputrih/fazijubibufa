Turner, who is nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, has an empty seat next to her. It’s unclear if her husband,<a href=#><strong> Joe Jonas,</strong></a> is set to attend, but if he does, the Jonas Brother will have the opportunity to chat with actress <a href=#><strong>Naomi Watts</strong></a>.</p><p>“I’m beyond humbled. I truly never thought that this would ever happen,” Turner wrote on her Instagram Story after learning about her first-ever nomination. “This is the best farewell to the show that has been my life for the past 10 years.”</p><p>Jonas, for his part, wrote <a href=#>that he was “so incredibly proud” of his wife</a>, who portrayed Sansa Stark during all eight seasons of the HBO hit.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Margaret Qualley</strong></a>, another first-time nominee, appears to be going solo to Sunday’s show, according to the chart. Us <a href=#>broke the news last month</a> that the Fosse/Verdon star, who is up for Outstanding Support Actress in a Limited Series or Movie, is dating <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“What the heck? I am stunned! I feel so honored to be nominated this morning, and alongside this crazy talented group of women,” Qualley said in a statement about her nomination. “I can’t believe it! Huge congratulations to Sam and Michelle, and the entire cast; and a very special thank you to Ann Reinking, who I grew up idolizing and am completely honored to have been given the opportunity to portray. She was more generous than I ever could have hoped for in helping me prepare for this role and I am lucky to now call her my friend.”</p><p>The 2019 Emmy Awards air live from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Fox Sunday, September 22, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>Scroll through to see where all of the stars will be watching the show!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bauq7F0maqnpmknruoecKhmKusXZ7AbrnAq56aqpWperLBwKWjnrFdl7%2BqusaipaBloJrBpnnDmq2inKOku3DAx6KqZqGjYsGpsYyfmKWbmKq4tHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./creamy-almond-pasta.html><span>←</span><span>Creamy Leek &amp;amp; Almond Pasta</span></a>
