The story follows a London Met police officer named Mackenzie Clark, who will be played by the former Home and Away star Anna Samson.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5579491e5be3-return-to-paradise.jpg><p id=e2_6kp-5Fqx data-wc=49>The Australian actress was originally born in the UK before growing up in Nigeria and eventually moving to Sydney as a teenager. She has some seriously impressive shows and movies in her filmography, including the HBO series The Leftovers, Dead Lucky, Hunters, Winners and Losers and Crime & Punishment. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d999631e5763-4346181908988066719300546692713281151529967n.jpg><p id=ePINjMMxVJL data-wc=65>Although Anna hasn’t spoken about the news just yet - she did reshare the casting announcement, which read: "Filming has officially commenced on Return to Paradise, Australia’s original spin-off series of the global smash-hit murder mystery franchise Death in Paradise. Taking charge as the franchise’s first lead female detective is <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>@annamaysamson</a> as Mackenzie Clarke, who’s made a name for herself for cracking uncrackable murder cases.”&nbsp;</p><h3>What is it about?&nbsp;</h3><p id=e1uw8TG-MavK data-wc=68>Mackenzie is smashing it in London Met, but after an incident at work, she reluctantly returns to her hometown of Dolphin Cove. Having left the town – and her ex-fiancée – six years earlier, she doesn’t receive a warm welcome back, but the local police station could certainly benefit from her skills - and she is soon tasked with finding out the killer in her first murder case.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Beyond Paradise is a hugely successful spin-off from Death in Paradise</figure><h3>Want more info?&nbsp;</h3><p id=e8ktS4vMGL5F data-wc=46>The official synopsis for the upcoming drama reads: “Australian ex-pat Mackenzie Clarke is the seemingly golden girl of the London Metropolitan police force – with an intuitive approach to detective work, she has built a reputation for being able to crack the most impossible of cases.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHTGTsNOtqL_ data-wc=51>“However, she’s suddenly forced to up sticks and move back to her childhood home of Dolphin Cove, a beautiful, coastal paradise… and Mackenzie’s worst nightmare… Having escaped her hometown at the earliest opportunity six years ago, Mack vowed she'd never come back, leaving a lot of unfinished business and unanswered questions.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f1566a51e59d-death-in-paradise-cast.jpg><p id=eebEgLyajj1x data-wc=85>“On her return she’s still no fan of the town, and the people of Dolphin Cove are certainly no fans of hers. Everyone would prefer her not to be there, including Mackenzie herself. But when a murder takes place in Dolphin Cove, Mack can’t help but put her inspired detective brilliance to good use and determines, despite her reservations, that she needs to make the best of it, including tying up the loose ends with the man she left at the altar six years ago.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Beyond Paradise star reveals why he was 'disappointed' after reuniting with co-star after 36 years" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4e0b8957293a-p0hh6m0p.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Beyond Paradise star reveals why he was 'disappointed' after reuniting with co-star after 36 years" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Beyond Paradise star reveals why he was 'disappointed' after reuniting with co-star after 36 years</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Beyond Paradise star shares rare insight into daughter Georgia's married life with David Tennant - exclusive" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/068a2a070af1-gettyimages-469853284.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Beyond Paradise star shares rare insight into daughter Georgia's married life with David Tennant - exclusive" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Beyond Paradise star shares rare insight into daughter Georgia's married life with David Tennant - exclusive</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Beyond Paradise's Sally Bretton reveals she ‘wasn’t ready to leave’ popular show" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/bcf4591897ad-421219.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Beyond Paradise's Sally Bretton reveals she ‘wasn’t ready to leave’ popular show" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Beyond Paradise's Sally Bretton reveals she ‘wasn’t ready to leave’ popular show</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h3>Who else is in the cast?&nbsp;</h3><p id=exifA6jscnxp data-wc=44>There is an impressive group of cast members for this one, with Ted Lasso star Lloyd Griffith joining Anna, alongside fellow Home and Away alum Tai Hara, Total Control actress Catherine McClements, The Artful Dodger star Andrea Demetriades and Gold Diggers actor Aaron McGrath.&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<h3>How does it link to Death in Paradise or Beyond Paradise?&nbsp;</h3><p id=eHoeWpd_w-1 data-wc=64>Since Death in Paradise and Beyond Paradise have a clear link in that Humphrey Goodman was a detective on the island of St Marie before heading to settle down with his fiance in Devon, it stands to reason that Return to Paradise might also see Mackenzie have some sort of link to someone from the DiP universe.
