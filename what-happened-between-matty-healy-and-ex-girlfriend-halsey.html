Then I’ll stop doing that."</p><p>When the reporter asked about his comment that he would become a parent, he said, "I’m too busy, but do you ever think that sometimes? God! Well, at least then me will go away! I’d like to become a vessel for somebody else’s happiness. That’s where I get meaning in life. I make music; it makes people happy. I find everything else a bit hard.

According to Us Weekly, she commented on his attention-grabbing personality and called him a "character."

But if you think he’s the first red-wine-­drinking, pretty-boy rocker in skinny jeans I’ve been associated with, you’re out of your f—king mind.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/untitled-design-5-5.jpg><p>While he might not want to say anything about Halsey, she doesn't mind praising Healy's talents as a musician. In 2016, she was a guest host on the SiriusFM show HITBOUND and talked about The 1975.</p><p>She talked about seeing them perform and said, “There was this choir, and there was these lights, and the sun was going down, and Matty Healy had makeup all over him. It was crazy.

In 2019, she was interviewed on the YouTube Channel AskAnythingChat. According to PopBuzz, she talked about splitting up with Yungblud and said that she is able to maintain platonic relationships with people who she was once romantically involved with.</p><p>Halsey said, "Sometimes. People just break up. It doesn’t mean someone cheated or something bad happened or someone f—ed up. Sometimes. It just happens. Because life is constantly changing.

Based on what I saw with the lyrics to "Colors" and the Insta post by Halsey that described the nature of their relationship, I think it kind of is. Also, Halsey DID cover The Sound and changed many of the lyrics to make the song sound pretty cynical towards Matty."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/matty-healy.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Matty Healy has never said that he wrote "The Sound" because of Halsey, it's interesting that she sang her own version of it. Of course, it's impossible to know if she did that on purpose because she knew the song was about her, or if she was just a fan of it.</p><p>Both singers have definitely moved on in the years since people think that they dated. People reported that Halsey and Alev Aydin broke up in April 2023. According to E!
