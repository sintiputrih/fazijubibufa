Ross playing the bagpipes along with Phoebe's reaction definitely ranks up there among the top moments of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=which-scene-was-jennifer-aniston-really-laughing-in>Which Scene Was Jennifer Aniston Really Laughing In?</h2><p><strong><a href=#>'Friends'</a></strong> had so many iconic moments throughout its decade long run. What makes things that much more remarkable is the fact that several of the great scenes turned out to completely unscripted.</p><p>Jennifer Aniston herself took part in a handful of those moments. The iconic, <a href=#>"world's worst hangover" line was completely spontaneous</a> and given the audience reaction, the show producers didn't think twice when it came to the final cut.</p><p>Credit to Aniston, she was also able to hold it together <a href=#>when Chandler accidentally smashed the cabinet on his head</a>... the hilarious moment was not supposed to take place and even Rachel was clearly holding in her laugh during the epic moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>'Friends' Decided To Shoot But Later Cut This Phoebe And Her "Medicine" Storyline</a></span></p><p>Aniston wasn't the only one involved with unscripted moments. In fact, Matthew Perry was a comedic genius during his run on the show. Between takes, the producers would typically ask Perry to come up with his own line and more times than not, it turned out to be better than the original.</p><p>Matt LeBlanc had a few unscripted moments himself - perhaps the most memorable was <a href=#>when he completely wiped out trying to answer the phone</a>, a scene the show decided to keep in!</p><p>Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer are responsible for this particular moment. One that is viewed as perhaps the funniest moment in the show's history. Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=ross-playing-the-bagpipes-caused-everyone-to-break>Ross Playing The Bagpipes Caused Everyone To Break</h2><p>When asked about her favorite episode on 'Friends', Lisa Kudrow brought up the Season 7, Episode 15, "The One With Joey's New Brain" moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although she doesn't remember much from the show,<a href=#> this moment definitely stuck.</a></p><p>"When Ross was learning to play, wanted to play the bagpipes," Kudrow confessed through spits of laughter. "He says, 'Sing along,' and Phoebe does. And he's playing 'Celebrate' by Kool and the Gang. It's so stupid and funny."</p><p>The moment was so iconic that the show ended up airing the blooper that took place after the episode. However, even during the take after the blooper, Jennifer Aniston was still noticeably smiling while it was taking place, while Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer somehow managed to keep things together. The moment can be seen below, showing the actual scene along with the blooper.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Producers Of 'Friends' Asked The Studio Audience If They Should Change Phoebe's Line Between Takes</a></span></p><p>During the blooper, the entire cast loses their cool including Matthew Perry, who is usually hard to crack.

In all likelihood, they played the moment on repeat. Here's what the fans had to say about the scene.</p><p>"I can watch it every day, this makes me cry of laughing !! Lmao! Friends is my Tv show for life."</p><p>"I like how Jennifer losing it behind her hand actually made the final cut."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I mean Lisa Kudrow singing "HEEEEEE" along to David's bagpipe rendition of "Celebration" was hysterical alone, everyone breaking down and then Matthew chiming in with his own bagpipe impression really was the cherry on top of the me-dying-of-laughter cake."</p><p>"No matter how old this video or Friends is, they still make me laugh with tears coming out of my eyes."</p><p>Fans were also crediting David Schwimmer for keeping a straight face throughout the scene, despite everyone laughing along with Phoebe's hilarious singing. "How does David Schwimmer keep playing??? I would've busted my ass off laughing!!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"David has the best scenes..and he is next level actor out there..he perfectly knows how to create comedy while acting in a scene and other emotions too…he doesn't need punch or sarcastic lines for that... sometimes his expressions are enough."</p><p>Major props to David Schwimmer and Lisa Kudrow for such an epic scene!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Courteney Cox Said This 'Friends' Cast Member Was The Worst At Memorizing Their Lines</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoyapaKrpKS7bsPArGScmaWctbV5y5qsoKCZo7RurthmnZqmo2Kxtr7Ip55mrJiewG60yKWYq6GfqsBuvs6sqmark5q7pnnIp2Sfqpmau6W%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fans-speculate-about-laverne-cox-character-kacy-duke-from-inventing-anna-where-is-fitness-guru-now.html><span>←</span><span>Fans Speculate About Laverne Cox Character Kacy Duke From Inventing Anna, Where Is Fitness Guru Now?</span></a>
