If receiving jewelry from a man since accused of being the mastermind of a major scandal wasn't enough, the diamonds weren't the only gift Low gave to Kerr, whom he reportedly dated for only a year. She also&nbsp;received a custom-built, see-through grand piano. According to <a href=#>The New York Times</a>, such a piece could cost anywhere from $170,000 to more than $1 million.</p><p>Per <a href=#>Page Six</a>, Kerr wasn't the only celebrity Low was using his ill-gotten gains to get close to; the financier also gifted Leonardo DiCaprio priceless Hollywood memorabilia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm9oaYV5e8eormalmaeur7DAZqKeqqJis7DBzZ1koZ2iqLKtsoyipWasmJp6rrXDnaOeZZ%2BbeqJ5w6KYpqeemXq0r8Cnm5qkXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./audra-mari-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Audra Mari PICS</span></a>
