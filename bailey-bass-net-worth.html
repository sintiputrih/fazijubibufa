All these hormones, it’s a lot.”</p><p>She used those struggles to connect with her character in Interview with the Vampire.</p><p>From modeling as a baby—something Bass jokingly calls the start of her career in entertainment—to finding her way to the big screen, Bailey stays remarkably down to earth.</p><p>She appeared in her first commercial at five years old, and her first independent short film at ten years old.</p><h2><strong>Avatar</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-77924 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bailey-bass-age.jpg.webp alt="bailey bass age" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bailey-bass-age.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-3 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-77924 class=wp-caption-text>Bailey Bass attends the Bach Mai fashion show during New York Fashion Week – @Getty</p><p>Just three years later, Bailey would get her big break, being cast in James Cameron’s sequel to the Epic fantasy film, Avatar.</p><p>She describes acting as her “consistent dream” and—although she had to miss prom to prepare for her role as Avatar’s Tsireya—she was determined to do the role justice.</p><p>This level of fame and public scrutiny would be difficult for anyone—at any age—but Bailey Bass has a trick for keeping things in perspective.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-57284 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bailey-Bass-Avatar.jpg.webp alt="Bailey Bass Avatar" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bailey-Bass-Avatar.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-4 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-57284 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>When she feels overwhelmed by everything her agent has flowing her way, she focuses on the short term.</p><p>“I’m like, ‘OK, but what am I doing tomorrow?’ If I think [too far ahead] I just get so overwhelmed.”</p><p>The trick has paid off handsomely—Bailey says she manages to stay fully present and has even found her niche in the drama genre.</p><p>With unlikely film influences like Diane Keaton and Gemma Chan, the star has gravitated towards “those really dark spaces and those dark emotions.”</p><p>During the film’s press release tours, Bass <a href=# rel=noopener>talks about</a> her great appreciation for being a part of such an iconic film. “It’s an honor. It really is. It was a big, long audition process, and to know that Jim put all his faith into us to play these characters. These really complex beautiful characters, it’s truly an honor.”</p><h2><strong>Interview with the Vampire…and Beyond</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-77925 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bailey-bass-date-of-birth.jpg.webp alt="bailey bass date of birth" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bailey-bass-date-of-birth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-5 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-77925 class=wp-caption-text>Bailey Bass is seen arriving to the Carolina Herrera fashion show – @Getty</p><p>Generation X will remember the sweeping, dark fantasy of the film adaptation of Anne Rice’s Interview with the Vampire.</p><p>For the television interpretation, the setting was moved forward a couple of centuries—to 1900s New Orleans.</p><p>Alongside Game of Thrones superstar Jacob Anderson—who plays Louis—and Newsreader star Sam Reid—playing Lestat—Bailey adds disturbing depth in her role as a teen vampire who will never age past 14.</p><p>Interview with the Vampire premiered in October of 2022.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Keston John Net Worth</a></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-77923 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/where-is-bailey-bass-from.jpg.webp alt="where is bailey bass from" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/where-is-bailey-bass-from.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-6 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-77923 class=wp-caption-text>Bailey Bass attends the 95th Annual Academy Awards – @Getty</p><h2><strong>Bailey Bass – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>So, how much is Bailey Bass worth?</p><p>Bass earned most of her wealth from performing in Anne Rice’s Interview with the Vampire and Avatar.</p><p>Her life has taken a serious change in a relatively short amount of time which is unusual for any new actress.</p><p>She was asked about her experience with fame and how it changed her life.</p><p>Considering her sweet demeanor and genuine disposition, her response came as no surprise. “I think we’re always going to stay humble and down to earth. I mean, we have to. We just love what we do, and the fact that we get to act every day is just really a blessing.”</p><p>Speaking about her family and how they’ve handled her inflated level of success, she humbly replies, “They’re really excited. They’re really excited, and I bought my family with me to d23, so the fact that they’re able to experience all of it with me is really fun.”</p><p>Therefore, Bailey Bass has an estimated net worth of $1.5 million.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>What is Annie Macaulay-Idibia’s net worth</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfl66quMSyZJuZo6h6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-tiktok-new-teacher-challenge-new-teacher-challenge-tiktok-videos-15843-html.html><span>←</span><span>What Is The TikTok New Teacher Challenge?
