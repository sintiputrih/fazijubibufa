Here’s why Tayshia and Zac ended their relationship.</p><p><b>Read More: </b><a href=#>Did Scott Cheat On Kourtney? Everything You Need To Know!</a></p><h2>Why Did Tayshia And Zac End Their Relationship?</h2><p>Fans were taken aback when Tayshia and Zac revealed their separation. The couple formed a close friendship while on the show.</p><p>Many admirers assumed the two would marry and have a happy life together. That, however, was not the case. So, why did the pair decide to end their relationship? Their hectic schedules, it appears, played a key influence in their breakup.</p><p>An insider told Page Six that the couple ended their romance because they were “on the same page” when it “came to the future.” With the passage of time, the couple decided to take a break.</p><p>“They have extremely different future ambitions.” “It’s both sad and relieved for them to finally acknowledge that they aren’t a good match,” the insider said. “Her star is developing so quickly, and he isn’t used to being in the spotlight.”</p><p><b>Read More: </b><a href=#>Khloe Kardashian Found Out Lamar Odom Was Cheating On Her</a></p><h2>Did Zac Cheat On Tayshia?</h2><p>Was Zac’s allegation about cheating on The Bachelorette last night true? Is Tayshia Adams being gullible by trusting him? Some supporters believe she’s foolish in this situation. Many individuals on the internet believe Zac isn’t sharing the whole truth, even if his statement is real.</p><p>Tayshia felt it was time to take her connections to the next level, in case you missed it. In other words, during a group date, she and temporary presenter JoJo Fletcher administered a lie detector exam. Naturally, some surprising information about one of the finalists surfaced. Or, to put it another way, he came clean rather than being caught in a falsehood.</p><p>Zac confessed to having cheated in the past after being hooked up to the lie detector gadget. To prove he was telling the truth, the light went green. However, while he may have been truthful, Tayshia found that information to be quite upsetting. After Zac’s confession, the season 16 Bachelorette was concerned, partly because cheating had been a problem with her ex-husband.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who else thinks Zac made up that 6th grade story to get out of telling her the truth about his cheating <a href=# rel=noopener>#TheBachelorette</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#bacheloretteabc</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FZrLE8fpPv</a></p><p>— thats some hot dish (@_fondue_for_two) <a href=# rel=noopener>December 9, 2020</a></p><p>Zac, on the other hand, revealed something different during the group date’s cocktail party. He told Tayshia that the cheating incident while he was in sixth grade. His alleged moment of vulnerability occurred in a bowling alley.</p><p>Tashia and Zac instantly made light of the situation. Both of them appeared relieved that it wasn’t as horrible as Tayshia had anticipated. Many admirers, however, believe she dropped the whole thing way too soon, claiming that his follow-up explanation was too good to be true, especially because Tayshia clearly believed it was the worst-case situation.</p><p>Naturally, some people turned to Twitter to express their displeasure with Tayshia for letting Zac off the hook so easily.</p><p>Someone pretending to be from the contestant’s hometown, however, supported Zac’s cheating story in a Reddit post. A screenshot of a tweet was published on Reddit, which you can see below.</p><p>https://twitter.com/CoachBuster/status/1336509170061881346?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1336509170061881346%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Facceptthisrose.com%2F2020%2F12%2F09%2Fzac-cheating-story-bachelorette-true-hometown-tayshia%2F</p><p><b>Read More: </b><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez Is Wearing The Most Extravagantly Be jeweled Wedding Dress</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX5m2pXnZmppmm5iarrV5zqdkrZmpqLWqrY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anya-chalotra-4.html><span>←</span><span>Anya Chalotra Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</span></a>
