The figure, and their masked henchmen, have attacked many AEW wrestlers, from The Acclaimed, to MJF, and most recently, "Hangman" Adam Page.</p><p>Fans have had a fun time guessing who the Devil is. In the beginning, many thought it could be Britt Baker, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she denied it in an interview</a>. MJF's Adam Cole would seem the most likely suspect, broken ankle or not. Many more names have been thrown out there, from Roderick Strong, former WWE star Mustafa Ali, or even MJF himself. The most speculated name has possibly been the former Jungle Boy, <a href=#><strong>Jack Perry</strong></a>. Perry has been absent from AEW since his suspension following his backstage brawl with CM Punk at All In. Many clues so far point to Perry as the Devil. With Anthony Bowens of The Acclaimed being thrown through a glass window, a glass beer bottle being broken over MJF's head, and Adam Page being slammed onto a car windshield, everything points back to Perry's "Real glass. Cry me a river," moment directed at Punk during All In.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>AEW is seeminly wanting fans to believe Jack Perry is the Devil. That's either because he is, or because AEW is creating a red herring, so we'll be shocked when the actual Devil is unmasked. According to Sean Ross Sapp of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fightful Select</a>, it doesn't look like Jack Perry will be the one revealed. Fightful Select reported that, after the end of Dynamite, where Page was slammed onto a windshield, they received a message from a high-level AEW source immediately who said they don't believe Jack Perry is involved in the angle. To add to this, even though Perry's suspension has been over for some time now, he hasn't been seen backstage in AEW since his match with Hook at All In.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/aew-devil-mask.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Everything We Know About AEW’s Devil, So Far&nbsp;</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>A Devil has been stalking MJF and his friends in AEW, but who is going to be revealed as the one under the mask?</span><h2 id=if-jack-perry-isn-39-t-aew-39-s-devil-who-is>If Jack Perry Isn't AEW's Devil, Who Is?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/aew-dynamite-devil-adam-page.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jack Perry would have been an intriguing choice to be the Devil. He has taken big steps since his heel turn, and his controversy surrounding CM Punk would only make him more interesting to watch. Many fans, however, have voiced disappoinment on social media at the possibility of a mid-carder being given such a huge role.</p><p>So, if the Devil isn't Jack Perry, who could it be? Will AEW have an already huge name under the mask, will they try to elevate a mid-carder to the main event, or will it be someone shocking out of left field, such as an ex-WWE star. Mustafa Ali isn't the only former WWE talent with their 90 day no-compete clause ending soon. Dolph Ziggler will be available in days, along with Shelton Benjamin, Elias, Riddick Moss, and others. Whoever is the Devil, with AEW struggling recently, they have to get the reveal right.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeRmsRusMSvoKVlnqTBbrbAnKJmqJWnv7p7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./josh-hart-height-how-tall-is-josh-hart.html><span>←</span><span>Josh Hart height: How tall is Josh Hart?</span></a>
