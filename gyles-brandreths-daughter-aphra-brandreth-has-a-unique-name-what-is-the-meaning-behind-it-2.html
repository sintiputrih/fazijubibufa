The name Aphra Word would be an interesting choice, especially considering she was the first professional female writer in English.</p><p>Aphra was a name given to several Roman saints and was originally a name given to a woman from Africa. It’s also known as Afra.</p><p>Her parents may have given her this name since it is uncommon and fits her personality.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gyles-brandreths-children></span>Gyles Brandreth’s&nbsp;Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>From his marriage to Michele Brown, Gyles had three children: Benet, Saethryd, and Aphra.</p><p>Aphra, his eldest daughter, followed in his footsteps and became a Conservative MP, but she never served in parliament.</p><p>Benet Brandreth is a well-known Intellectual Property barrister, rhetoric coach, and Shakespeare expert.</p><p>There is no information on Saethryd since she avoids the spotlight and likes to keep her private life hidden from the public eye because she believes in simple living and lofty thinking.</p><p>Despite the fact that his children work in different fields, he loves them all equally.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gyles-brandreths-family-tree></span>Gyles Brandreth’s Family Tree<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Charles Brandreth, a legal official with the Allied Control Commission, was Brandreth’s father when he was born.

In a new book, Phillip the Final, he shared his memories.</p><p>Giles and his beloved wife Michelle are now retired and living in Barnes, Southwest London, with their children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2BpobK0ecGrmKecoprBqb%2BMnZiun5ipsrN5wKmfq5ldl7%2BiusOrnK2gXZ2utHnAZqynoaGqsm66wKacZq%2BYlsFutdJmq6GdXaKyorrIp55mmpWdtq%2BwjKKrZmpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./get-to-know-molly-grace-marsh-biography-age-career-net-worth-height-relationship-more.html><span>←</span><span>Get to know Molly Grace Marsh: Biography, Age, Career, Net Worth, Height, Relationship &amp;amp; More</span></a>
