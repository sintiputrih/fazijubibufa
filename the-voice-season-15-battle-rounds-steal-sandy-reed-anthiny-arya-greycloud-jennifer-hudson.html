<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>'The Voice' season 15: Four &amp;quot;steals&amp;quot; that floored us during the first week of battle round</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The battle rounds continue next week on 'The Voice' season 15, and we will see the coaches -- Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Hudson, Blake Shelton and Adam Levine -- pairing more artists from their teams for a head-to-head duet.</p><p>Apart from the onstage battles, fans also eagerly look forward to the "steal".&nbsp;Each coach gets two steals, which is an opportunity to choose a contestant who has been eliminated from the battle round to join their team. This week alone, we witnessed 4 steals, and it comes as no doubt that these artists are deserving enough to be given a second chance.</p><p>Some eliminations were shocking too, like that off Sandy Redd, who was later stolen by Hudson. With the battle rounds set to return next week again, here is a small throwback to all the steals witnessed this week.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Currently SWOONING! and are BRINGING it to “Amie” by Pure Prairie League.</p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 17, 2018</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>When the battle rounds commenced on last Monday, we witnessed probably the most shocking elimination of this season, and which led to a perfect steal. It left us all asking a major question to Clarkson, 'What were you thinking?'.&nbsp;</p><p>Clarkson chose Cody Ray Raymond and Sandy Redd, who received a&nbsp; four-chair turn, to go against each other in the battle round. Battling it out by performing 'Cry To Me' by Solomon Burke, the stage was lit and you could see the chemistry between the two. Both performances were no doubt unique in their own way. It complemented the song in a really beautiful way; her&nbsp;raspy tone was just the right match to his low voice.</p><p>By the end of the battle, Kelly was torn between who to select as the winner. With her powerful voice and four-chair turn during the blind auditions, everyone thought Cody was a no-brainer. But Kelly thought otherwise. Her decision not only left the judges spellbound but the audience too. But then the other three judges made the best of this opportunity and hit their buzzer to steal her. But Sandy chose Jennifer Hudson.&nbsp;</p><p>This brings Hudson up the winning scale because she now has 3 powerhouse performers in her team. Which automatically means, Kelly, who was up the pedestal with a higher chance of winning this season, was brought down a notch below Hudson, who now becomes the judge most likely to win the season.</p><p>Following Sandy Redd's steal, the next singer who was up for steal was from Hudson's team. She paired Colton Smith and Patrique Fortson, battling it out for Blake Shelton’s own 'God Gave Me You.'&nbsp;</p><p>They both had an impressive range in their voices, making their battle even which suited them both. It definitely was a heated battle that left Hudson torn between her choice. But in the end, there can be just one winner, and that was Fortson, but all hope was not lost for Smith because Shelton swooped in and stole him, keeping him in the competition. Phew! Two steals on a single day.&nbsp;</p><p>Tuesday was a whole new day the competition on stage had the coaches sitting at the edge of their seats wondering would they would choose and who would be eliminated.</p><p>The first contestants to perform were from Clarkson's team; this time she paired the mixed-race gay duo OneUp to battle against&nbsp;Kymberli Joye. This time she seemed to make a good decision and chose Joye as the winner. But sadly no one came up for a steal and OneUp were the first ones to get eliminated that day.&nbsp;</p><p>After that came Anthony Arya and Steve Memmolo from Adam's team.&nbsp;Singing a slow version of 'Amie' by Pure Prarie League, both artists sounded great and gave their best. Adam was left with a tough choice, because as much as he loved both their performances he had to let go of one. Though he admitted that Arya had something quite unique and interesting about his voice, he chose Memmolo as the winner.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/78c6bc4b-a78e-46f1-9ff6-a49e954074f8.JPG><p>But Hudson seemed to know that Arya would make a great addition to her team, and used her final steal and rescued him from elimination and added him to his team. Hudson sure seems to know what she is doing this season as the coach because she has quite a lot of good performers in her team. This makes her the strongest team with a high chance of winning this season.&nbsp;</p><p>The final steal of the week came from Hudson's team which also happened to be the last performance for the day.&nbsp;She chose Mike Parker and Natasha Greycloud to battle it out in a duet of John Mayer's 'Gravity'.&nbsp; Despite both scoring negative points during their rehearsals, they hit the stage with a whole different story and ended up with a flawless performance.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/d1036340-02a2-4c29-bf83-0ba13a86d462.JPG><p>After applause from the judges and the crowd, Hudson was left with a tough decision yet again. Since only one can emerge as a winner Hudson ended up choosing Parker. But it was a lucky day for Greycloud because Clarkson used her first steal and took her into her team.&nbsp;</p><p>With the first week of battle rounds all done and dusted, comparing all the steals that happened, the one that stood out was that of Sandy Redd. She was definitely the star of the show. With everyone agreeing that she has the highest chances of winning this season, she is definitely the front-runner and the one to look out for this season.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorJiaere7yJycZquVlsCwuoxqbGaakanBrbGMq6auppSoerTAxJqjZquRo7G6edGenJ1lkaPBqbXNsmSaqqmWeqi%2BxLKapaelmXqrsc2noJ%2BdomK1trDSqKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-ann-romney-mitt-romneys-wife-age-wiki-biography-children-net-worth-family.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Ann Romney?
