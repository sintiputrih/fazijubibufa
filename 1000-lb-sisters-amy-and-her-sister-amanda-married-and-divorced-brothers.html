Her goal is to lose 80-100 pounds and just be happier.</p><p>She wants to wait a while before dating again so she can focus on herself.</p><p>The divorce between Amy and Michael has been ugly so far. Before Michael filed for divorce on March 17, Amy filed an order for emergency protection on February 28 and opened a domestic violence case.</p><p>A few days before Amy made these filing, police had been called to their home because of a domestic disturbance. The 911 call reveals that Amy accused Michael of “throwing things” during an argument. Michael told police at the time that Amy wanted to end the marriage, but he did not.</p><p>On March 8, the protection order was amended to let Michale have supervised contact with the children.</p><p><br><br><br></p><a title="Web Analytics" href=# rel=noopener><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/c.statcounter.com/8656821/0/6134e3f5/1/ alt="Web Analytics" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p><br></p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3><span class="share-item twitterbtn"><a href=# class=twitter-share-button data-via=starcasm>Tweet</a></span> <span class="share-item gplusbtn"></span><span class="share-item facebookbtn"></span><span class="share-item pinbtn"><a href=# class=pin-it-button count-layout=horizontal>Pin It</a></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FpK3SpmWnnaRkfnF8j2ajm2WjnsC1sdGsZJqlqWKur7CMoZyrZaOewLWx0WaYppmema5uucCrqaKdlGKur7CMnaCvp6KYsqV5waumraCVp8Bw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./troy-sanders-19730908-html.html><span>←</span><span>Troy Sanders (Rock Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
