Who is the hottie in the drivers seat 😈 🙌.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Vanderpump-Rules-Raquel-Leviss-Is-Seeing-Businessman-Matthew-Dunn-But-It-s-Too-Soon-to-Label-It-420.jpg><p>A second user teased, “This driver is definitely an upgrade, go girl!!”</p><p>Later that month, the <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> alum attended <a href=#>Stagecoach Music Festival</a> in Indio, California, with a group of friends. Dunn, however, didn’t appear to be part of Leviss’ desert crew.</p><p>Dunn is a former sergeant in the United States Marine Corps, according to his <a href=# rel=noopener>LinkedIn profile</a>. He is currently the CEO of Dunn Investment Group, which is headquartered in Spokane, Washington.</p><p>Leviss’ choice to keep her budding romance with Dunn somewhat private comes after a very public breakup with <strong>Tom Sandoval</strong> in 2023.</p><p>Leviss and Sandoval, 40, began hooking up in late 2022 while Sandoval was dating and living with <strong>Ariana Madix</strong>. Us confirmed in March 2023 that Madix, 38, and Sandoval <a href=#>split after nine years</a> together in the wake of the affair.</p><p>Sandoval and Leviss were grilled by their VPR costars during the season 10 reunion, which filmed that same month. Leviss subsequently checked herself into a mental health facility in April 2023 and in time <a href=#>cut off all communication</a> with Sandoval.</p><p>Leviss chose not to return to VPR for season 11, and later took back her given name of “Rachel” as part of her <a href=#>personal refresh</a>. Leviss declared that in 2024 she was <a href=#>focusing on herself</a> and not worried about finding love again right away.</p><p>“I’m not dating for a year, and in doing that, I’m just focusing on myself and after this talk, focusing on my emotions that come up for me,” Leviss said on a January episode of her “Rachel Goes Rogue” podcast. “Like what are my own needs that I need met? And not adding an additional person into the equation. So that it is just focused on me and other people as well my friends and family and the people that are in my inner circle that are safe friends.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The following month, Leviss took legal action against Madix and Sandoval, claiming they eavesdropped on her, invaded her privacy and administered revenge porn after her affair with Sandoval.</p><p>While Madix confirmed that she did learn about Sandoval’s cheating through a video of him and Leviss “having phone sex,” she denied she shared the footage with anyone but Leviss.</p><p>Both Sandoval and Madix have filed legal documents requesting the lawsuit be dismissed or amended. Madix also claimed in April <a href=#>court documents obtained by Us</a> that Leviss’ lawsuit was a way to “punish” and “blame” her for the “negative reaction” Leviss received for her part in the scandal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGavmZ6ZsrO81KanZqqlobK0edGaqK6dnGK5psLIrKpmq5Watq%2BzjKaYrayYmsRusNSnpWaZlqmys3nSnJinnJ%2Brrq17</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-plays-the-bachelorette-inspired-prank-on-kris-jenner.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian Plays 'The Bachelorette'-Inspired Prank on Kris Jenner</span></a>
