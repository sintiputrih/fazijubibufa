Despite that, they shared their Instagram stories like it was no big deal.</span></p><p><span>In the aftermath of Ari Fletcher accidentally posting the video of her on Instagram, Moneybagg posted her own video on her private social media platform which went viral.</span></p><p><span>After mistakenly posting the video, Ari quickly clarified the situation. The video gained a lot of attention in a short period of time.</span></p><h3><span><b>A Video Posted By Mistake By Ari Fletch</b><strong>er</strong></span></h3><p><span>In a March 26 Instagram story, Ari showed off her curves in a white thong while wearing a white thong.</span></p><p><span>However, Ari promptly deleted the video, claiming that she made a mistake while uploading it. It was CF y’all getting in trouble with me in that video. “Well, I’m in trouble, but please remove that video.”</span></p><p><span>Her reference to the people sharing the video on other platforms after she had deleted it was in reference to those who did so after it was deleted.</span></p><h3><span><b>Moneybagg Yo Share Ari Fletcher Videos</b></span></h3><p><span>Ari’s real name is DeMario DeWayne White Jr. Moneybagg, whose real name is DeMario DeWayne White Jr., also posted some videos of Ari on Instagram. In his post, the social media influencer wore the same outfit that she had shared on his Instagram story.</span></p><p><span>Ari’s twerking video quickly garnered the attention of fans, but unlike her, Moneybagg decided to keep it on her Instagram account. It seems that the rapper shared it shortly after Ari did on his social media accounts, so the couple’s breakup rumors are unfounded.</span></p><h3><span><strong>When did the two begin dating?</strong></span></h3><p><span>Distractify reported that Moneybagg and Ari have been dating for four years. Although they have experienced ups and downs, at the end of the day, they seem to have worked things out.</span></p><p><span>Recent rumors suggested that there was trouble in paradise and that it might have caused a split. Posting videos to their Instagram stories, the two quickly dismissed these complaints.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiclZbBqbnIpaCtoZFjsLC5jpqpomWWobK1r8eeqWasp5q%2FrLXNoGSvoZSavHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-rosenfeld-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Rosenfeld Net Worth</span></a>
