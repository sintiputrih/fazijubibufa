Since spring has finally sprung, we’ve finally set into the realization that the warm weather days are here to stay. We want to look our best before beach season officially arrives and there’s no time like the present to get a move on. The time may be ticking, but there is still time!</p><p>We found the easiest way to jumpstart healthy living. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Boombod</a>&nbsp;is making getting into shape for the summer a bit easier with an easy-to-use program.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/boom-bod.jpg><p><strong>See it: Grab the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Boombod Achiever </a>with prices starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">$40 </a>and get one free at Boombod — You save $39.99 (50% off)!</strong></p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Boombod 14-Day Achiever</a> is a <a href=# data-link=1>cleanse</a> comprised of “shot drinks” to give us the instant boost — or shot — of confidence. The two-week program is the most popular, but there’s also 7-day and even 28-day options — all of which have a BOGO deal right now!</p><p>It’s not that we don’t want to work out. It’s just that we don’t always have the time.&nbsp;From jam-packed schedules to last-minute events, it’s rare to ever find spare hours. And if we do find the time? Well, we’re too worn out with our day to drag ourselves to the gym or even press play and do an at-home workout video. We know, we know, excuses, excuses. Well, not anymore!</p><p>The Boombod system is not only simple to use, but it’s also a sugar-free, gluten-free and even dairy-free formula. It contains no added aspartames or laxatives and best of all? No caffeine! It’s also vegetarian-friendly, too, which is one of many reasons why it has so many fans! In fact, over 1,000 users loved how this product had them achieving all of their fitness-related goals when mixing the shot drinks their day-to-day routines.</p><p>The most popular flavor with Boombod fans is blackcurrant, which is a strawberry-like blend. But there’s also lemon-lime and orange mango flavors available.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/second-pic-bb.jpg><p><strong>See it: Grab the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Boombod Achiever </a>with prices starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">$40 </a>and get one free at Boombod — You save $39.99 (50% off)!</strong></p><p>The problem most detoxes or crash diets? They’re too complex. From overly difficult meal plans to insane workout regimens, sometimes preparing for the diet is actually harder than the diet. Not here! Boombod looks to bring it back to the basics and makes it easier than ever.</p><p>Simply take a shot with a glass of water about 30 minutes before meals in the morning, afternoon and night, all of which are labeled for easy use. The Morning Energizer has iron, magnesium, vitamin C and Glucomannan to help boost metabolism. The Afternoon Motivator shot includes zinc, vitamins B12, B6 and B1 to help overcome mid-day crashes. The Night Rejuvenator is formulated with biotin, selenium, vitamin D3 and Glucomannan for overall health.</p><p>The real power of the product? Well, that can be found in the reviews, of course! Over 1,000 reviewers raved over the simplicity of this system. Across the board, reviewers said they felt more energized and overall better. Many noted how they felt less bloated and lost the urge to snack mindlessly. One reviewer even claimed this tasty treat helped satisfy and kick their sweet tooth.</p><p>Looking and feeling good has never been simpler!
