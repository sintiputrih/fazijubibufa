One of those players is #065, Dylan Scanlon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@dylanscanlon_ href=#>@dylanscanlon_</a><p>Replying to @lizza a Few things to know in <a title=squidgamethechallenge href=#>#SquidGameTheChallenge</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Dylan Scanlon" href=#>♬ original sound – Dylan Scanlon</a></figure><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to his biography on Netflix’s website</a>, Scanlon is a 23-year-old from New York. At the beginning of the competition, he shared that he wanted to use the prize money to take his mom on a nice vacation if he won. He previously posted a lot of workout content across his social media, but more recently he has been sharing behind-the-scenes information about his time on the show.</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=161 data-injectable=false>He’s done everything from explaining his point of view after conflicts on the show to sharing what Netflix gave the contestants while they were competing.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">On his Instagram</a> he not only posts about his time on the show, but he also posts some of his work as an actor, and gives fans a glimpse into his personal life. But perhaps what fans care most about, is the posts he continues to make with his friends from the show, even saying that the competition had them bonded for life.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@dylanscanlon_ href=#>@dylanscanlon_</a><p>It’s important to note, what you see is only the edited version of what really happened. Per productions request every marbles game had to have the rules and how to win established BEFORE playing the game, nothing could be changed once the game had started. You couldn’t determine the winner at the end of match because that breaks the agreed upon rules stated earlier, which is what we see at the end of the game. Me following instructions, isn’t a judgment of my character or who I am as a person. Linking the confessionals directly after the game from both player 399 & myself (065) in my bio. More to come but I’m not a manipulator & I’m not a bully – I won’t be made out to be that way, I was just adhering to the rules of the game. <a title=squidgamethechallenge href=#>#SquidGameTheChallenge</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Dylan Scanlon" href=#>♬ original sound – Dylan Scanlon</a></figure><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, Scanlon made his exit from the show in episode 7. He and another player failed to come to a compromise after a game where they threw marbles into a jar, and both of them were subsequently eliminated. he caught a little bit of heat for the way that he went out, but on his TikTok he shared that their conversation was edited and he was just following the rules of the games, saying that the results that followed weren’t totally on him.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=247 data-injectable=false>The final episode of Squid Game: The Challenge will be available on Netflix on December 6. With only 9 players left, it sure to be a drama-filled experience. Until then, fans can tune in to Dylan’s social media for the behind-the-scenes tea.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxllK65orqMqaOasZWnenGClGamp2WjpsKqsIygmKadXam1pnnCoZilpJWjtKZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luke-chiang-age-and-wiki-how-old-is-the-singer.html><span>←</span><span>Luke Chiang Age And Wiki: How Old Is The Singer?</span></a>
