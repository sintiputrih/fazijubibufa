Eduardo was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil on March 19th in 1982. His father Roberto worked as an industrialist, focusing on export, including clothing and shipping, and his mother Paula was a psychologist. It‘s also worth noting that his grandfather Eugenio was the founder of the Tip Top chain. He was brought up in a Jewish household in Rio de Janeiro, until 1993 when the family moved to Miami, Florida in United States. There Saverin attended high school and after graduation started studies at Harvard University, where he met <a href=#>Mark Zuckerberg</a>. While studying there, he joined the Harvard Investment Association. Before even finishing university, he had already made $300,000 from clever investments in oil companies. In 2006 Saverin finished Harvard with a bachelor in Economics. He is also part of the Alpha Espsilon Pi.</p><h3>Eduardo Saverin Net Worth $4.8 Billion</h3><p>So how rich is Eduardo Saverin now? Reliable sources have estimated that Eduardo has a fascinating net worth of $4.8 billion. Not only is this a huge amount for one person, it‘s more than some companies are worth. The biggest chunk of Eduardo‘s net worth has come from being one of the co-founders of the social networking giant, Facebook.</p><p>Besides Eduardo, the founders of Facebook were <a href=#>Mark Zuckerberg</a>, <a href=#>Dustin Moskovitz</a> and <a href=#>Chris Hughes</a>. When Facebook was started by <a href=#>Mark Zuckerberg</a> and his roommate <a href=#>Chris Hughes</a> in Harvard University, Eduardo provided them with the early funds, earning him a third of the young company‘s shares. When <a href=#>Dustin Maskovitz</a> joined, Saverin‘s part of shares dropped to around 30%. After Facebook launched on February 4th of 2004, the rest of the team moved to California, while Eduardo stayed behind. Eduardo worked as a business manager and chief financial officer in the newly-made company. Over time, Facebook‘s finances were managed by outside investors, and Eduardo‘s role lessened. Then the company sued Saverin for alleged interferance with business. Saverin sued back, hoping to keep his 30% of the shares. He won the right to be mentioned as a co-founer on the website, but his stake plummeted to 5%. In September of 2011, Eduardo gave up his U.S. citizenship reportedly to avoid taxes after the initial public offering of Facebook. According to The Wall Street Journal, Eduardo saved $700 million worth of tax by doing this.</p><p>Besides Facebook, Eduardo has invested in Qwiki and Jumio, both of which provided a slight boost to his net worth, since the companies stayed moderately successful.</p><p>Eduardo, along with other names behind Facebook, were immortalized in 2010 movie The Social Network, depicting the story of Facebook‘s creation. In it, <a href=#>Andrew Garfield</a> plays the role of Eduardo Saverin. The film was very well received by both the public and critics.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=6.7319277108434><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$4.9 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 19, 1982</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Profession</td><td>Businessperson, Entrepreneur</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Harvard University (2006), Gulliver Schools</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Brazil</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Paula Saverin, Roberto Saverin</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Alexandre Saverin</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Eduardo Luiz Saverin</td></tr><tr readability=0.38095238095238><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/edusaverin</a></td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjp6brpmimbxuv8CvnKuhnmK7psCMsKarrJhk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dateline-kill-switch-lori-isenberg-poisoned-her-husband-to-conceal-her-embezzlement-scandal.html><span>←</span><span>DATELINE Kill Switch Lori Isenberg poisoned her husband to conceal her embezzlement scandal</span></a>
