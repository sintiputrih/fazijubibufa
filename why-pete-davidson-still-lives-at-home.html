He has all of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his time on Saturday Night Live</a> to thank for that.</p><p>Pete claims that the excessive amount of video games and video game equipment that litter is basement-house are really for his little cousins who come over to visit and tend to destroy the knobs on the controllers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But we're not sure we believe him...</p><p>Because, in his heart, Pete is still a big kid.</p><h2 id=pete-wants-to-be-close-to-his-momma>Pete Wants To Be Close To His Momma</h2><p>The last time Pete Davidson was on The Howard Stern Show, he was still with Ariana Grande. Although, given how quickly he's moved from starlet to starlet, it doesn't seem like THAT long ago...</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What It’s Like To Date Pete Davidson, According To His Exes</a></span></p><p>Since then, he has made multiple movies, had a successful stand-up career, and also brought home the bacon on SNL. But he chose to purchase a house with his mom and stay with her.</p><p>According to People, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete and his mom went in on a house in Staten Island together</a>. Although he claimed the decently large basement suite for himself.</p><p>Pete told Howard that he had planned to move out before the world was hit by the pandemic, but chose to stay in his home to be able to isolate with his family. Given how so many people around the world are separated from their loved ones, this does make a lot of sense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But that doesn't explain why Pete decided to live with his mom in the first place.</p><p>He and his mom have a truly authentic connection. Yep, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete has a soft side</a>.&nbsp;Pete tragically lost his dad on 9/11, and that event made him even closer to his mother. They rely on each other. They keep each other going in hard times.</p><p>In short, Pete deeply loves his momma.</p><h2 id=the-basement-allows-pete-the-chance-to-escape-just-not-from-his-mom>The Basement Allows Pete The Chance To Escape... Just Not From His Mom</h2><p>Pete told People Magazine that the basement he built was for him to escape people. It's hard to imagine Pete wanting to escape from other human beings when he's spent so much time with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an array of women who some claim were far out of his league</a>.&nbsp;But perhaps all this scrutiny contributes to why he wanted to isolate long before COVID-19.</p><p>His basement, dubbed "The Cave", is where Pete spent most of his time away from SNL, and where he spends practically all of his time now.</p><p>Before the pandemic, his buddies would come over and play video games with him while his mom cooked them dinner upstairs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fact that Pete's mom is so close has made it virtually impossible for him to bring any women home... including Margaret Qualley and Kaia Gerber.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">17 Pics Of Kaia Gerber When She Thought No One Was Looking (And 3 With Pete Davidson)</a></span></p><p>Pete told Howard that one of his greatest fears is his mother coming downstairs and catching him in the act, especially if he's engaging in it on his own. Therefore, he has to time these activities when he knows his mom is out or busy doing something else.</p><p>He also has his sister to contend with, who lives on another floor of the Staten Island house.</p><p>It's like being a teenager again.</p><h2 id=the-basement-is-a-boy-s-dream>The Basement Is A Boy's Dream</h2><p>Between the copious arcade games and the wall that all his guests sign, Pete Davidson's basement is a boy's dream. Although, according to People, Pete loves his DustBuster the most. The compact vacuum easily allows him to clean his basement suite kitchen, where some of his friends actually get tattoos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pete also has a tricked-out shower and an extensive shoe collection that would make Jennifer Lopez blush. Among his most valued pair is a signed sneaker from Shaquille O'Neil -- it's wrapped in plastic, never to be worn.</p><h2 id=a-different-lifestyle-than-he-almost-had-but-it-may-not-be-forever>A Different Lifestyle Than He Almost Had, But It May Not Be Forever</h2><p>Pete Davidson's swanky"Cave" is still a lot different than the Manhattan apartment that he purchased, and almost lived in, with Ariana Grande. According to People, it cost them a whopping $16 million... Although, that's chump change for Ariana.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos Of Pete Davidson Before, During And After Ariana Grande</a></span></p><p>Of course, living together for a prolonged period didn't end up happening. Forcing Pete into his mother's basement.</p><p>Chances are, Pete won't be there forever. At some point, he will have to move out into his own home and live life like an adult.</p><p>But until the pandemic is declared over, chances are he's going to be continuing to relive his childhood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class="related-single next-single">Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Pete Davidson Facts That Leave Us Scratching Our Heads (But Are Hard To Ignore)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdpbK1sYydmK%2BhlKi8r3nSraClpF2htrex0maYrWWYpLqmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./worlds-oldest-beds.html><span>←</span><span>Scientists Find 200,000 Year Old Beds In South African Cave</span></a>
