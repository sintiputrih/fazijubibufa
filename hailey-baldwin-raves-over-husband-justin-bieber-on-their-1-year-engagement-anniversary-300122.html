To celebrate the milestone, the model took to social media to post a sweet pic and dedicated a message to her now-husband and their love.</p><p>‘1 year ago I said yes to being your best friend for life, and today I’ve never loved you more. Life gets more beautiful every single day because of you, my heart belongs to you forever. Here is to learning and growing together,’ Hailey wrote in the caption of the snap that featured her and Justin on a mountain together.</p><p>In the pic, Justin wears a pair of green shorts and no shirt while also rocking a teal hat.</p><p>He is looking away from Hailey who wore a teal, grey and brown jacket and paired it with brown cowboy boots.</p><p>Hailey posed by leaning on her husband with her eyes closed.</p><p>The model’s celebratory post comes almost a week after Justin got in a bit of hot water for defending manager Scooter Braun amid his war with Taylor Swift.</p><p>Even Hailey’s support to her husband got some hate since she wrote ‘gentleman’ in the comment section and people were quick to argue that his post was not exactly gentleman-like.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘As the years have passed we have not crossed paths and gotten to communicate our differences, our hurts and frustrations. So for you to take to social media and just get people to hate on scooter is not fair. What were you even trying to accomplish by posting that blog? seems to me like it was [for you] to get sympathy you also knew that in posting that your fans would go and bully scooter,’ Justin wrote alongside an older pic of him and Taylor.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeYlratsdhmmZqklKy2r3nRmq2eq12kw6a%2BjKGsrJqRo7FuttSsq6KmXZe2pq7Eq2Sopl2ptaa10WZoZrGVlr9usc2gmKCdnZq7tXnAp6WirpWnwKK%2B2GZqaWhhZ39w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./freddie-aguilar.html><span>←</span><span>Freddie Aguilar</span></a>
