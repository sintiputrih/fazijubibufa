In fact, the original cast has already discussed about new episodes.</p><p>“I definitely think it’s possible and I think everybody would love to,” the actress, 38, exclusively tells Us Weekly. “There is so much love there and such fond memories of our time on the show. I feel like we kind of ended before we really wanted to and I think there is a lot of goodwill in that world and I know everybody would be supportive of it.”</p><p>She adds: “I know there has definitely been a lot of talk about it.”</p><p>The Kevin (Probably) Saves the World star played Cheyenne on the beloved series, which ran for six seasons from 2001 to 2007. Cheyenne moves into her newly divorced mom’s (<strong>Reba McEntire</strong>) home as she raises her child with her high school boyfriend Van, played by <strong>Steve Howey</strong>.</p><p>“I think Van and Cheyenne would still be together and define all odds in their own quirky way. But it takes a village and that village was really strong,” Swisher tells Us. “They were the definition of a modern family. It was a very real and supportive family, a loving family and at the end of the day regardless of all the insanity that was circling our lives we loved each other until the end. And I think that allows you to beat the odds.”</p><p>In real life, Swisher, who recently teamed with Clorox, is mom of daughters Emerson, 4, and Sailor, 19 months, with husband <strong>Nick Swisher</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/reba-cast.jpg><p>For more, read the rest of her Q&A in our Now and Then series:</p><p><strong>Us Weekly: Do you run into Reba or reunite with the cast often?</strong></p><p><strong>Joanna Garcia Swisher:</strong> All the time! We are all extremely close. I actually just saw Reba last month. We were at the CMAs together. But we talk all the time. Reba’s got a tight hold on her little brood because she makes sure we are all doing OK and taken care of. And Melissa Peterman is a really dear friend and a part of my family. We’re all just very close.</p><p><strong>US: Do you have any memorabilia?</strong></p><p><strong>JGS:</strong> Yea, I have a ton. I have braces that I wore in a flashback scene. I have some clothes that I probably shouldn’t have taken because I probably wasn’t allowed to but I did. We have just so many fond memories. We vacation together. We were all so close on a personal level too so a lot of fond memories.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/joanna-garcia-swisher.jpg><p><strong>US: How would you describe Steve as a scene partner?</strong></p><p><strong>JGS:</strong> Unbeatable! The best. He’s heaven. He’s so beyond talented and I love him personally. He’s got such a beautiful family and he’s such a good human. But he’s seriously one of the more talented people that I’ve ever worked with.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>US: What was one of your favorite scenes between Cheyenne and Van?</strong></p><p><strong>JGS:</strong> We had so many good ones. One of my favorite scenes in the whole show is when Van was going on a talk show for football and I was going to be on it with him. Barbra Jean was giving us a lesson on how to be on camera and be on a talk show. Literally I get tickled every time I just think of shooting the scene because those two are by far some of the funniest people I’ve ever worked with and know. They were just cracking me up. I could barely get through it. It’s one of my favorites. It’s a perfect depiction of our wild, insane personalities coming through.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmempFiv6bCyK%2BYpWWZqHqlscWipaKslaHGbrzOrKqimpyaequ7wKelmmWXlr%2BktcBmqrCho52ys3nSmrCsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kiss-html.html><span>←</span><span> Prince Kiss lyrics</span></a>
