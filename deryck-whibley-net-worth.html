During Deryck’s career as a producer he has had an opportunity to work with Tommy Lee, The Operation M.D., Permanent Me, <a href=#>Avril Lavigne</a> and many more.</p><p>So just how rich is Deryck Whibley? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that Whibley’s net worth is over $6 million as of mid-2016, and as Deryck continues his career as a musician, songwriter and producer, there is a high possibility that his fortune will grow in the future.</p><h3>Deryck Whibley Net Worth $6 Million</h3><p>Deryck’s family moved to Ajax, Ontario where he attended Southwood Park Public School, and then matriculated from Exeter High School. Deryck and his friends formed several bands before they landed as members of Sum 41 in the late ’90s, but Whibley is also a successful producer, working with the&nbsp; music management company called Bunk Rock Music. There he collaborated with many artists, including No Warning, Tommy Lee, Permanent Me and others, all of which has had a huge impact on Deryck’s net worth.</p><p>Sum 41 formed in 1996; now the members of the band are Deryck, Jason McCaslin and Tom Thacker, with Deryck able to play the guitar, bass, piano, keyboards, drums and Mellotron as required.In 1999 Sum 41 became a part of Island Records, and since then the band has released nine albums, including All Killer No Filler, Does This Look infected?, Does This Look Infected Too?, Underclass Hero, Screaming Bloody Murder and All the Good Shit: 14 Solid Gold Hits 2000-2008. All these albums were very successful and positively effected the growth of Deryck Whibley’s net worth. The group has won a Juno Award and was nominated for a Grammy Award.</p><p>In addition to music, Whibley acted in “Dirty Love” and “King of the Hill”, thus of course adding to his net worth.</p><p>As Deryck is a well known musician there is no surprise that his personal life is also well known to the public. He married Avril Lavigne in 2006, having met while they were teenagers, and the couple performed together occasionally, however, they divorced after three years. Lavigne suggested that Deryck’s problems with drugs and alcoholism were over – he was even hospitalized because of alcoholism – but apparently not completely.</p><p>In August 2015, Whibley married model Ariana Cooper in Los Angeles. As Deryck is only 36 years old, there may still be possibilities for him in the future, so there is also a high chance that if he continues his career as a musician and producer, Deryck Whibley’s net worth will become higher.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.5><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$6 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 21, 1980 (age 35</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Scarborough, Toronto, Canada</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 6 in (1.7 m)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Record producer, Songwriter, Guitarist, Actor, Musician</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Canadian</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Avril Lavigne (m. 2006–2010)</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Jocelyn Aguilar</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Nicknames</td><td>Deryck Jayson Whibley , Gunner , Bizzy D , Derzhik Wibly , Derik Uibli , Sven , Deryck Jason Whibley</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Music Groups</td><td>Sum 41 (Since&nbsp;1996), Young Artists for Haiti (2010)</td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjp2cq7GToHq4tMibo56xXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ami-mcclure-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Ami Mcclure Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
