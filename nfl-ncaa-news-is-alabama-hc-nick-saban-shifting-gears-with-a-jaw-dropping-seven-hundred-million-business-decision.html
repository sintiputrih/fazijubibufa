Currently, the 8-1 Crimson Tide is the leading team in the Southwest Conference, another milestone Saban is already proud of. Saban has crafted an exquisite team through the years, paving the way for 6 national championships, 4 of them being in consecutive years from 2014 to 2018. Along with his 16 legendary years as the head coach of the Alabama State, Saban has developed an appetite for luxury cars as well.</p><p>Fueling that hunger further, the Alabama head coach struck a baffling deal with the world’s finest: Mercedez Benz. Saban, also the co-owner of Dream Motor Group, is not new to expanding his business, spanning out their dealerships across the States.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Nick Saban’s solid portfolio</h2><p>The Dream Motor Group, following the footsteps of the same expansion mindset, purchased $700 million worth of two South Florida Mercedes-Benz stores. This marks the entry of Dream Motor Group in Florida. The deal covers the buildings, land, franchises, and body shops. Earlier this year in July, the organization also acquired the Mercedez-Benz in Cutler Bay and Coral Gables, along with Bob and Paula Brockway’s Bill Ussery collision center.</p><p>Furthermore, the group owns dealerships in Texas, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Alabama. If this alone was not impressive enough, Saban co-owns yet another dealership in Nashville, this time with Ferrari, along with an Infiniti in Birmingham, which totals around 10 dealerships. The hard-earned business acumen of Nick Saban and the co-owner of Dream Motors Joe Agresti are surely aiding them in creating a vast empire.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Future Prospects for Mercedes</h2><p>Saban has leveraged his coaching career earnings like a pro for Dream Motors. Especially when the veteran coach spends the majority of his time away from the deal cracking deals and generating more brand value for the company. Saban is already a face in advertisements with insurance brands. Moreover, Saban has also signed another <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>commercial with Colorado head coach Deion Sanders</a>.</p><p>Read Also: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>“Busted a Blood Vessel”: Concerns Mount Over Head Coach Nick Saban’s Eye Health, May Impact Coaching Style in Alabama Crimson vs. LSU Football Match</a></p><p>The Alabama head coach’s recent trip to Italy was a carefully calculated move to further strengthen ties with Ferrari. Even celebrities couldn’t resist Saban’s company’s charm. Quinton Judkins, the Ole Miss running back as well as the 2022 SEC Freshman of the Year, secured a lucrative NIL deal with Mercedez-Benz of Birmingham. These all, iter-waved with Saban’s deliberate moves of expansion not only bring Dream Motors more into the spotlight but also create a base for an empire of much larger magnitude.</p><p>Watch this story: <strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Deion Sanders Son Shedeur Puts Tom Brady on a Pedestal for Helping Him Escape and Move Around Amidst Great Expectations From Him.</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue82fo2amk5aubrrEsKpmoaNirq2twZqkmmWYmHqvtcKkZKyZkpa7br%2FHop2toZ6ceqixwKuqZq%2BZqbVurYyjmLBllKe8sbzIp55mq5Wrsq95x66lnaqVmXqutculoKimXZfCtLXNnqqsZZSasKq%2FyKilaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-style-heeled-loafers.html><span>←</span><span>Heeled loafers: 11 killer outfit ideas to help you style the 90s footwear trend</span></a>
