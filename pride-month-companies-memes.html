These memes smirk at the June 1 quick-change.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The inauthenticity and obvious pandering many companies engage in on their socials and in their ads is pretty embarrassing. It often makes you wonder if anyone who actually identifies as queer was involved in the decision making process for their Pride Month marketing strategy.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>This year the sudden change over to Gaylight Savings Time was made all the more jarring for its erasure of support for <a href=#>Ukraine</a>, whose <a href=#>occupation by Russia</a> certainly didn't end on June 1.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>On the left? That's an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actual post from the U.S. Marines</a>. That one on the right is a meme, but it isn't far off from the real thing. It's a little funny when you recall that, before 2011, the military could dishonorably discharge you for coming out of the closet.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>This one works best if you remember the episode of The Office where Michael tries to show Oscar he's an "ally" in the most inappropriate way possible. Dunder Mifflin really needed a better HR department.</p><p>Regardless... the way corporate America tries to ram its tongue down the LGBT+ communities' collective throat, it's a pretty apt comparison.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">As many have pointed out, most companies' Pride Month campaigns are rarely about acceptance and more to do with $$$.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>We guess it must work because every year more and more corporations jump on the bandwagon.</p><p>A newer phenomenon is brands teaming up with content creators and influencers, sometimes with hilariously awkward tie-ins.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">At least sometimes queer-identified folks can cash in with corporate partnerships.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>As a gay black woman who grew up in a cult, I was afraid to come out of the closet.

For virtually every marginalized identity that gets their own designated "month," it's the same story. Companies flood the timeline with support for the Black community every February, followed by women in March, and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in May.</p><p>But rarely do the corporations do provide any tangible support to the challenges those communities face, and after the month is gone, they return to the status quo.</p><p>Anyway, Happy Pride!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGinaKiinrGmecyopa2gXZi8rrzAp6Ceq12isq6x0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-third-baby-trying-pregnancy-kuwtk.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Kim Kardashian Is Trying for a Third Baby but Doctors Warn of Risk</span></a>
