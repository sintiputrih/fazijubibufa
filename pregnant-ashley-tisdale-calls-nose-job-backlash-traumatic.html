I made a decision that was no one’s business (and is STILL no one’s business) and for that decision, I was constantly made to feel bad about it.”</p><p>The Phineas and Ferb alum, who is <a href=#>pregnant with her first child</a>, revealed in her blog that her nose job was brought up again in a recent interview. Tisdale was caught “off-guard” by the interviewer’s question.</p><p>“At the end of the day, I’m having a daughter, and I hope her choices aren’t met with judgment or shame,” she said. “It’s taken years for me to process this experience — an experience that I didn’t think was that big of a deal either.”</p><p>Tisdale continued, “I’m choosing to look at this interview (which was a bummer) as a positive. It brought up a very dark time in my life. Things like having paparazzi break into my home to get the ‘first shot,’ and feeling like I let people down were the first things that came to mind. BUT I’m choosing to see this as a push to face it, write it down and finally let go.”</p><p>Although she struggled with her nose job, the New Jersey native went under the knife again. In August 2020, she revealed that she had a <a href=#>breast implant removal operation</a>. The High School Musical star shared the news on Instagram.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Ashley-Tisdale-Reflects-On-Traumatic-Inline.jpg><p>“As you know, I’ve been very open about <a href=#>my mental health journey</a> and feel that this is equally important,” she captioned a social media post. “Years ago, I underwent breast enhancement surgery. Prior to the surgery, I constantly felt my body was less than, and thought this change would make me feel more whole and more secure about myself. And for a short period of time … it did.”</p><p>She continued, “But little by little I began struggling with minor health issues that just were not adding up — <a href=#>food sensitivities</a> as well as gut issues (full story on [my blog] @frenshe) that I thought could be caused by my implants. So, last winter I decided to undergo implant removal.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602aYrKCcmsZuwMism5qklWKworjLrGSnp6Oaequ7wWaZmpuboa60tIytqZqtnZbBqq%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oliver-peck.html><span>←</span><span>Oliver Peck-Bio, Age, Height, Nationality, Facts, Net Worth</span></a>
