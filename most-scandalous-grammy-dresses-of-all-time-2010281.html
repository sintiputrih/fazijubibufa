The stunning red carpet appearance <a href=#>was the famous inspiration behind the creation of Google Images.</a></p><p>The singer — <a href=#>who rewore the gown to close out Versace’s fashion show in 2020</a> — later recalled how she felt wearing the dress each time.</p><p>“The first time I wore it, I actually didn’t have another dress. Usually I have choices. It was a last-minute thing that caused a sensation that was unexpected,” she told Vanity Fair in September 2020. “The second time was very planned-out.”</p><p>Lopez continued: “<strong>Donatella [Versace]</strong> said, ‘You know, this year is the 20th anniversary of the jungle dress. I think I’m going to do a whole show about it. Would you come?’ And I said, ‘Of course. Just call me.’ It’s all timing, schedules and stuff. And then she wound up calling and said, ‘I want you to walk at the end, and I want you to come out in the dress.’ The same dress. We’ll make a new one for you.'”</p><p>The Hustlers star <a href=#>recalled the emotions that came with wearing the ensemble</a> again, saying, “The second time I wore it and walked out there, it was such an empowering thing. Twenty years had gone by, and I think for women, knowing you can put on a dress 20 years later — it resonated. It was like, ‘Yes, you know, life is not over at 20!'”</p><p>While filming her Netflix Halftime documentary, Lopez said <a href=#>she struggled with the comments made about her body due to the iconic outfit.</a></p><p>“When I started working, the beauty ideal was very thin: blond, tall, and not a lot of curves. I grew up around women with curves. So it was nothing ever I was ashamed of,” she detailed in the 2022 documentary. “It was hard when you think people think you’re a joke, like you’re a punch line.”</p><p>At the time, the New York native admitted <a href=#>she thought about quitting because of negative comments about her.</a></p><p>“No matter what I achieved, their appetite to cover my personal life overshadowed everything that was happening in my career,” she continued. “I just had very low self-esteem. I really believed a lot of what they said, which is, I wasn’t any good, that I wasn’t a good singer, I wasn’t a good actress, I wasn’t a good dancer. I wasn’t good at anything. I just didn’t belong here. I felt like I was in this really abusive, dysfunctional relationship.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Later in the film, footage showed Lopez receiving a hug from Vogue editor <strong>Anna Wintour</strong> <a href=#>when she put on her Versace gown for a second time.</a></p><p>Scroll down to see the most scandalous, revealing and daring dresses worn to the Grammys:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvMqKqtZaOYrq%2BwwKWmrqtdnL%2BiucyyZJ2qlajApr%2BMqJ1mmZyherW1zJ5ka2hhZX95fY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./surnames.html><span>←</span><span>Last name ADONIS: origin and meaning</span></a>
