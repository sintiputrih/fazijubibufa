Rather than let its plot rest on merely competing to form relationships, Perfect Match allows its competitors to play a role in their fellow contestants’ partnerings. The most compatible couple is provided the opportunity to mix and match their fellow contestants, making and breaking relationships on a whim.</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>Several standouts are already prompting conversation, particularly as reality television favorites make their return for the fresh Netflix series. Rising stars like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bartise Bowden</a>, of Love is Blind fame, quickly caught fan attention, but not to the degree of Chloe Veitch. The reality show veteran is an easy favorite among fans of the genre, and they’ve got questions.</p><h2 id=h-you-ve-seen-chloe-veitch-before data-injectable=false>You’ve seen Chloe Veitch before</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Chloe (@chloeveitchofficial)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=693 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>Perfect Match is far from Veitch’s first brush with fame. The 23-year-old has become a household name in reality television circles, as she continues to dazzle with each fresh appearance. Arguably best known for her winning stint on Too Hot to Handle, Veitch is a vital element of each competition she’s appeared in. As mentioned above, she cinched a joint win during her 2020 appearance on Too Hot to Handle, and, a year later, became a fan favorite on The Circle. She also managed to secure the “runner-up” vote on the social media-styled series, and participated in Celebrity Ghost Trip, along with both Celebrity Hunted and Eating with my Ex between 2021 and 2022.</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false>She’s once again an easy favorite in The Perfect Match, despite her brief stint in the series.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Her height, age, and social media</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Chloe (@chloeveitchofficial)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=532 data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true>Veitch is easy to track down on social media, which is great news for the 23-year-old’s many fans.
