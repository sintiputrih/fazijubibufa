He likely didn’t expect the response she gave. Not wanting her to have all the attention, he posted a reply (with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pizza box that got too much attention</a>). Shortly thereafter, Romanian authorities just so happened to arrest Tate after a month-long investigation into his alleged <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">involvement in human trafficking</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>yes, please do enlighten me. email me at <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=e49789858888808d878f818a8196839da483819085888d8281ca878b89>[email&nbsp;protected]</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/V8geeVvEvg</a></p>— Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) <a href=#>December 28, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=719 data-injectable=true>Since his arrest, Andrew Tate, or someone in his entourage, is still tweeting from his account despite him being detained for a month. This is not to be confused with fan accounts. His Twitter handle is @cobratate and it’s where he posted his video reply to Greta and was the same account that was banned in 2022 only to be unbanned upon Elon Musk’s takeover of the bird app. He presently has 4.5 million followers.</p><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>Suddenly, it appears that Andrew Tate’s account is being sneakily hidden by Twitter. If you type in anyone’s account name then it obviously results in that account popping up first. Yet, with “cobratate,” not only does his account not pop up at all but only one account is suggested. Which account? You guessed it: Greta Thunberg. Her account even stays on the top if you move the tab to “people,” with Andrew Tate’s account nowhere to be found.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/7A2BED6C-8C99-4D81-A68F-B6D2086DBA63.jpeg><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>It’s so blatant that Twitter doesn’t even make the account appear on their searches at all. You would think it doesn’t exist and that’s likely what Twitter wants you to think, but it most certainly exists and, unless you already follow @cobratate, you would have to find another account that just so happened to tag him and then you can access it from there.</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=227 data-injectable=false>Even if you add the “@“ before the handle, thus “@cobratate,” then you will only receive a large number of Tate’s fan accounts which strongly suggests that his own account is likely being targeted directly by Twitter.</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>What does this all mean? Well, if you’re not a Tate fan then it means a minor victory. However, if you are a Tate fan or just simply think such things shouldn’t happen, then you might be concerned because if Twitter is shadowbanning people then they are not exactly committing to the freedoms that Elon Musk promised when he first took over.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>Furthermore, why go the sneaky route? If Andrew Tate has violated guidelines (he was banned before), then why not terminate his account? Perhaps the publicity is too much for Musk to handle so he’s hoping that no one will notice. Well, sorry Elon, but we got this covered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SxqrCMra6irKSav265wKScZpmemb%2Bmw4ytmK2dXaq7tLHAq5qhmZKhsm6tzZ1krK2XnLK0wIygqZ6skWLBqcHNm5yrn12eu7TAxJqbaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./icrackstreams-com.html><span>←</span><span>Crackstreams - live sports streaming</span></a>
