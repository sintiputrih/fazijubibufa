Since a freestanding tub isn’t limited by the need to fit between walls or into tile, it allows for more creative design choices. From a classic clawfoot form to a modern egg shape, a freestanding tub gives any bathroom a luxurious feel.</p><p>The Stretto has a simple, contemporary look and features an ergonomic design for comfortable soaking.

People typically install them outdoors, but you can also incorporate them into indoor spaces for a luxurious spa experience.</li><li><strong>Spa tubs:</strong> These options are in-ground and often custom-made. “Spas can be part of a larger pool, or paired with a home sauna for the ultimate relaxation station,” says Murphy.</li><li><strong>Whirlpool tubs:</strong> These tubs feature adjustable jets that create a swirling <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/article/therapeutic-vs-recreational-hot-tub/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">water massage</a>, providing relaxation and relief for sore muscles.</li><li><strong>Air tubs:</strong> Instead of jets, air tubs release bubbles into the water for a gentle, soothing massage. They offer a quieter and more subtle <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/list/products-that-make-soaking-in-the-tub-even-more-relaxing/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">relaxation experience</a> compared to whirlpool tubs.</li><li><strong>Freestanding tubs:</strong> These tubs are standalone units and are not attached to the bathroom walls. <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/article/freestanding-tubs/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">Freestanding tubs</a> provide flexibility in placement and come in <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/article/what-to-know-about-clawfoot-tubs/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">various shapes</a> and designs.</li><li><strong>Plug-and-play hot tubs</strong>: “These portable spas are self-contained and have everything they need to operate, including a power cord,” says Murphy. “They are usually made with an acrylic interior and a wood, metal or plastic exterior.”</li><li><strong>Inflatable hot tubs:</strong> “Few spas are more versatile than <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/article/inflatable-hot-tubs/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">inflatable hot tubs</a>,” notes Murphy. Made from latex or vinyl, they are easy to install and budget-friendly.

First, decide if you want a freestanding tub, which, as the name suggests, stands alone without attaching to the walls. You can also purchase an <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/article/alcove-bathtub/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">alcove tub</a>, which is more common and typically cheaper, as it usually fits into pre-existing tub spaces.</li><li><strong>Space and layout:</strong> Evaluate the available space in your bathroom and choose the best<a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/article/jacuzzi-vs-hot-tub/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links"> jacuzzi tub</a> that fits well without overcrowding the area.</li><li><strong>Size:</strong> When replacing an existing bathtub, match the size, shape and water connections of the prior tub. Also consider tub depth and height. The taller the tub, the more soaking you can do in the water. However, bigger tubs can be expensive to ship and difficult to install.</li><li><strong>Material:</strong> Materials like acrylic and fiberglass are popular for being durable, easy to clean and for offering quality insulation. Copper and stone resin bathtubs are long-lasting options but require a high upfront investment.</li><li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Think about the ease of <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/project/how-to-clean-your-bathtub/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">maintenance and cleaning</a>, as some tubs may have features that make it simpler to keep them in good condition.</li><li><strong>Cost:</strong> Set a budget for your jacuzzi tub, taking into account not only the <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/article/how-much-does-a-hot-tub-cost/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">purchase price</a> but also potential installation and operating expenses.</li></ul><h2><strong>How We Found the Best Jacuzzi Tubs</strong></h2><p>As shopping experts, our only job is to help you find a winning product.

Self-contained jets, designed to maximize comfort while soaking, are powered by water or air. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>What’s the difference between a jacuzzi and a spa tub?</h3><p>“The simple answer is, the terms <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/article/questions-for-buying-a-hot-tub/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">hot tub</a> and spa tub can be used interchangeably, and a jacuzzi is a specific type of hot tub,” explains Murphy. “All the terms describe a tub or pool of warm, relaxing water.” The difference between a jacuzzi and a spa tub comes down to it being in-ground vs. above-ground, she adds. Hot tubs, like jacuzzis, are above-ground and portable; while spa tubs are in-ground and often custom-made.</p><h3><strong>How do you clean a jacuzzi tub?</strong></h3><p>Many experts recommend using vinegar as a simple, affordable <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/list/hot-tub-cleaner/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">cleaning solution</a> for your jacuzzi tub. You should fill the tub with enough hot water to cover the jets, add a half cup of vinegar and run the jets to circulate this mix throughout the system.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p63MoqOyoJGjsbq5wKdlnKedZLmqv9NomZ6rpGLAsa2Mo5icraqvtm6uwK2fra2SqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tbt-reese-witherspoon-ryan-phillippe-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe Both Say This Is the Reason Their Marriage Ended</span></a>
