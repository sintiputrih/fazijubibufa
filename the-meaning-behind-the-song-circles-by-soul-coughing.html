It was released as a single from their album “El Oso” in 1998. The song quickly gained popularity, becoming one of Soul Coughing’s most successful songs to date.</p><p>The lyrics of “Circles” explore themes of monotony, frustration, and the longing for something more. It starts with the lines, “When you were languishing in rooms I built to file you in, and when the wind set down in funnel form and pulled you in.” These opening lines paint a picture of someone trapped in a confined space, feeling stuck and unable to escape.</p><p>Throughout the song, there is a recurring refrain: “I don’t need to walk around in circles, walk around in circles, walk around in circles, walk around in… Don’t need to walk around in circles, walk around in circles, walk around in circles, walk around in.” This repetition emphasizes the frustration and desire for change.</p><p>The second verse introduces the theme of violence, with the lines, “And when the ghostly dust of violence traces everything, and when the gas runs out just wreck it, you insured the thing.” Here, the lyrics suggest a destructive cycle that repeats itself, leaving the protagonist feeling trapped and hopeless.</p><p>The bridge section of the song adds an interesting twist to the meaning. It includes the repeated lines, “Doom da doom da doom, well I’m going, I’m going.” These lines bring a sense of defiance and determination. It signals a resolve to break free from the circles and monotony.</p><p>As the song progresses, it becomes apparent that the protagonist has made a decision to move forward. The lyrics state, “But I can’t sigh now that you made the move, it has gone and gone to dogs, lay down on the floor. For the right price, I can get everything, slip into the car, go driving to the farthest star.” These lines suggest a sense of liberation and a willingness to venture into the unknown.</p><p>Soul Coughing’s “Circles” captures the frustration of feeling trapped and stuck in a monotonous routine. It is a song that resonates with anyone who longs for change and seeks to break free from the cycles that hold them back. The repetitive nature of the lyrics amplifies this message, while the bridge provides a glimmer of hope and determination.</p><p>Personally, “Circles” holds a nostalgic place in my heart. It reminds me of my teenage years, when I often found myself yearning for something more in life. Whenever I listen to this song, it serves as a reminder to break free from the comfortable yet stagnant routines and pursue my dreams.</p><p>So next time you find yourself feeling trapped and frustrated, give “Circles” a listen. Let the infectious groove and meaningful lyrics remind you that you have the power to break free from the circles and create your own path.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Album_Information></span>Album Information:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>– Album title: El Oso (1998)</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Credits></span>Credits:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>– Produced By Soul Coughing & Tchad Blake</p><p>– Written By Sebastian Steinberg, Yuval Gabay, Mark Degliantoni & Mike Doughty</p><p>– Recorded At Sunset Sound Factory, Hollywood, California</p><p>– Release Date: September 29, 1998</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tags></span>Tags:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>– Rock</p><p>– Indie Electronic</p><p>– Neo-Psychedelia</p><p>– Alternative Rock</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jrBpaKyYmnquscCnoKefXZeyqbXNnWStoJViwLC6xmaaoqqTobK0ecGyZKynpaF6pLvUoJ%2Bippdk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./queen-latifah-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Queen Latifah Net Worth: A Multifaceted Talent with an $85 Million Net Worth</span></a>
