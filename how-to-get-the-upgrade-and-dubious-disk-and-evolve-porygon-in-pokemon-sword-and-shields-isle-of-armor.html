Start in the Warm Up Tunnel and exit towards Training Lowlands. On the left between the beach and entrance to the cave will be some boulders. The upgrade is laying on the ground there. If you do not want to go out and find the item yourself, you can craft it using the Cram-o-matic in the Master Dojo by using Yellow Apricorn, Big Nugget, Big Mushroom, and a Star Piece.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/17211322/upgrade-850x448.jpg><p>Next, you are going to want to evolve your Porygon. Make it hold the Upgrade and trade it to a friend who will trade it back to you and you will have Porygon2.</p><p data-injection=true>Now that you have a Porygon2, you will need the Dubious Disk to further evolve it. The item is sitting on a small patch of sand out in the ocean to the far south of the Isle of Armor in the Workout Sea. You can see exactly where with the below video.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p data-injection=true>Make your Porygon2 hold the Dubious Disk and again trade it to a friend who will trade it back to you. Do this and you will now have its final stage, Porygon-Z.</p><p>For future Pokemon guides like this, be sure to stay tuned to Gamepur.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9f567079c0123aedc955a07bc9df406d?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>John Hansen</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>John Hansen is a Full-time Staff Writer for Gamepur as well as a host for the YouTube channel Pixel Street Videos where he co-hosts a weekly gaming podcast and more.
