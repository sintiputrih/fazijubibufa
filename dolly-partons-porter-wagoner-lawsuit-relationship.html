She wrote:</p><p>He gave me great opportunities, and I did appreciate him. Later on, we got back together and he said he was sorry about all of that. So I forgave him, and I asked him to forgive me. I’m sure I was a pain in the a*s to him. I was, because I believed in what I believed in, and I was going to fight for it. There’s truth on either side.</p><p>Parton also wrote about how <strong>their relationship blossomed till Wagoner’s final days</strong> on earth. In fact, Parton was by Wagoner's side two hours before he died.</p><p>A few months before Wagoner died in 2007, Dolly Parton honored him with a beautiful rendition of “I Will Always Love You” at the Grand Ole Opry.
