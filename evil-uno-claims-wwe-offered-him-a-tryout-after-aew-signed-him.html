Before Brodie Lee joined the faction and elevated it, Evil Uno and Stu Grayson handled the Dark Order.</p><p>Evil Uno and Stu Grayson are true veterans in the pro wrestling world with several years of experience under their belts. Them signing with AEW was inevitable as well.</p><p>While speaking on a recent&nbsp;<a href=#>episode of&nbsp;Talk Is Jericho</a>, Evil Uno and Stu Grayson asked about their pro wrestling careers. Chris Jericho asked them if they received any offers from WWE. Evil Uno revealed that he did get an offer for a WWE tryout, but it was only after he signed with AEW. The two would then explain that WWE was never their end goal.</p><p>Surprisingly enough, the only tryout offer I got was once I was offered a contract here. I never seeked for it either. In my first, I’d say nine years, I just thought it was an impossible feat because I wasn’t ginormous. I’m a little masked guy who’s a video game character, and I’m from Canada. So in my mind, I was like, that’s not even my goal because I had instilled in my brain as a kid that I’m a kid and I can’t get there.</p><p>Funny enough for me, when I started was in 2004 – 2005. What I was watching the most was TNA because that was the golden years of the X-Division with guys like AJ [Styles] and Christopher Daniels, and I look at them and I was like, ‘Oh, those guys are my size. I could do this. That’s the place for me.’ So WWE was never even an option for me either. I didn’t really think about it.</p><p>The Dark Order remains one of the mainstays of AEW television and that is unlikely to change anytime soon. We will have to see what is next in store for the faction.</p><p><strong>Are you surprised to hear this story about WWE trying to sign Evil Uno?
