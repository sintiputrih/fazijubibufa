And here's <strong>Kandi Burruss-Tucker</strong>, an already established musician. In fact, you rarely get a Grammy-winning songwriter in the Real Housewives franchise. She's been bold enough to pursue entrepreneurship as well, so don't be appalled by her massive net worth.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Born <strong>Kandi Lenice Burruss</strong> on May 17, 1976 (age 44), in College Park, Georgia, to the Reverend <strong>Titus Burruss Jr.</strong> and <strong>Joyce Jones</strong>, she suffered an early tragedy in her life as she lost her older brother, <strong>Patrick Riley</strong>, aged 22 in 1992, when she was just a teenager. He just missed seeing his little sister on the way to stardom as her music career took off the next year.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/91091902_263571444658429_4155836203541156439_n.jpg alt="Kandi Burruss has a whole lot of money for net worth." width=450 height=556 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Kandi Burrus is a singer, songwriter, TV personality, actress, and businesswoman.</strong><br><strong>Photo Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kandi Burruss, Instagram</a></strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>For someone who's been on the show as long as she has, she obviously knows how to make her mark. Aside from the budding friendship with <strong>Cynthia Bailey</strong>, when <strong>Kenya Moore</strong> gossiped about Kandi earning the highest-salary of the cast, it was not something she could swallow. But that doesn't hide away the fact that she still earns pretty for her decade long association with RHOA.</p><h2>With a Net Worth of $32 Million, Kandi Burruss Is the Richest Atlanta Housewife</h2><p>As of April 2020, Kandi Burruss controls a multi-millionaire net worth of <strong>$32 million</strong>. The testimony to such a fortune is her two-decade + music career as well as an acting/producing career and all-in-all influencer as a TV personality. But hey, seven-plus ventures have it rolling piles of green on her way. The RHOA salary doesn't matter too much to her growing income, and she isn't afraid of rolling out some of it to meet the desire of her flashy life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_cherylrobinson_files_2019_01_image8-1200x800-1.jpg alt="Kandi Burruss, entrepreneur, on the Bedroom Kandi Convention 2018." width=450 height=381 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>One of Kandi's Business Ventures is an adult-toy company.</strong><br><strong>Photo Source: Morriside Photography</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Burruss's ventures include Bedroom Kandi, Kandi Koated Beauty, Old Lady Gang, Raising Ace and TAGS Boutique, all with their own distinct, characteristic flair. For example, Bedroom Kandi offers people looking for consulting positions to join her team in promoting her brand (over 2,500 consultants right now). Old Lady Gang is a Southern eatery established with her mother and aunts. And TAGS Boutique is a luxury women’s apparel.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>'Xscape' Broke Up Because LaTocha Scott Wanted to Go Solo, & Burruss Claims It Was Not Because of the Allegations Against Her</h2><p>Burruss was introduced into the glam world when she was in the ninth grade, aged 14 [1990]. The sister, <strong>Tamika Scott</strong>, of <strong>LaTocha Scott</strong>, a former member of <strong>Precise</strong>, met Burruss when they were attending Tri-Cities High School in East Point, Georgia, together. They started performing together, with a fourth member in <strong>Tamera Coggins-Wynn</strong> who wanted out after a short while.</p><p>The band <strong>Xscape</strong> was officially formed when <strong>Tameka</strong> "<strong>Tiny</strong>" <strong>Cottle</strong> was asked to audition. The group's first-ever TV performance was in the BET series, Teen Summit, in 1992, as they sang a cover of En Vogue’s Hold On. Burruss was 15, and it was a group of five as Tamera was still with them at the time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They were thus introduced to record executive <strong>Ian Burke</strong> and managed by him. In 11th grade, <strong>Jermaine Dupri</strong> discovered the female R&B quartet in Atlanta (yes, Tamera had left the group by then) and signed Xscape to his recording label So So Def Recordings. Thus, before attending school for 12th grade in the summer of '93, they released their first single, Just Kickin' It, which was an instant hit.</p><p>The group then started working on their first album together throughout 12th grade and came up with a full studio album by October 1993. On October 12, 1993, Hummin' Comin' at 'Cha was released which went RIAA Platinum within a year, apart from peaking at #17 on the U.S. Billboard 200 list and #3 on the Top R&B Albums chart. They were releasing singles for the album afterward as well.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Burruss graduated high school in 1994 with Tamika as they started working on a second studio album. Another Platinum hit, Off the Hook, was released on July 18, 1995, under So So Def Recordings. But around the time, LaTocha expressed her desire to go solo. Burruss had bought her first house at 19 and was trying to figure out how she could make a living once the band splits.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-103201152.jpg alt="Kandi Burruss and Jermaine Dupri " width=450 height=312 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>There were some allegations on the relationship between Burruss and Dupri.</strong><br><strong>Photo Credit: Moses Robinson, WireImage</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Xscape did release a third studio album, Traces of My Lipstick, on May 12, 1998, which did well sales-wise, as it went Platinum too, but failed to garner similar success as the previous album. It topped #28 on Billboard 200 list and #6 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Album chart. And soon, LaTocha went on her pursuit of a solo career and the band finally disbanded. According to reports, all three albums added <strong>$1 million</strong> each for Burruss's net worth.</p><p>However, they did later regroup for appearances on the Big Momma's House [2000] & Hardball [2001] soundtracks and performances on <strong>Lil Bow Wow</strong>'s Bounce with Me [2000] & Jermaine Dupri's Rock with Me [2001]. They went apart after that, but when their comeback attempt was announced in 2005, it wasn't as exciting as it used to be. They did release a single, What's Up, that year.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Xscape: Still Kickin’ It was announced when Burruss learned of TV One planning a movie in 2017, and she wanted positivity around the group which might not have happened if TV One had released the movie instead. The group thus released a 4-episode mini-series, as they regrouped again. But before joining again, Burruss wanted an apology from Tamika.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dish-031915-kandi-xscape.jpg alt="Kandi Burruss and her gang of Xscape." width=450 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Xscape's second hit single was called 'Understanding'.</strong><br><strong>Photo Source: Bravo TV via Kandi Burruss.</strong></p><p>It turns out in a 2007 interview, the latter had claimed that Xscape broke up because of Kandi sleeping with Jermaine Dupri and his father, <strong>Michael Mauldin</strong>. Kandi did confirm the relationship with Dupri but insisted it was not why the group broke up at all. She did <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">get the apology from Tamika</a>, and they are still best friends. Xscape also released an Extended Play, Here for It, on March 2, 2018, under RedZone Entertainment.</p><h3>The Solo Career — Coincidental Credit for Ed Sheeran's 'Shape of You'</h3><p>It was not all over for Kandi after the group disbanded in 1998/99. She focused on production and songwriting, grouping up with Tamika, aka Tiny, in 1999 for their project: demo songs to record labels. Their first manager, Burke, introduced them to record producer, <strong>Kevin </strong>"<strong>She'kspere</strong>" <strong>Briggs</strong>. And they created what Kandi calls "the biggest song of my career."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kandi-tiny-660x400-1.jpg alt='Kandi Burruss and Tameka "Tiny" Harris.' width=450 height=272 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Burruss and Harris are still BFFs.</strong><br><strong>Photo Source: Kandi Online</strong></p><p>When Briggs played Kandi & Tamika "this track", they asked him for it to rewrite the words which thus became 'No Scrubs'. Someone had played in for <strong>L.A. Reid</strong>, who wanted it for TLC, telling them he would make it the biggest hit in the world during a meeting at a party. And so it did, it became the international number one hit. A modest <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kandi Burruss tells Forbes</a>,</p><p>I took for granted what he was saying. He was right, though. It ended up being the biggest song of my career. It was a blessing. It just kind of fell into my lap.</p><p>Since then, it was an okay career for her in the solo path. She released her first album, Hey Kandi..., under Columbia Records on September 19, 2000, which didn't do too well in the charts (#72 on Billboard 200), but the single, Don't Think I'm Not, did peak 24 on Billboard Hot 100.&nbsp; But that wasn't the whole point of her solo career. From then on, she became a successful songwriter. She's already written the debut for <strong>P!nk</strong>, There You Go, and Bills, Bills, Bills for <strong>Destiny's Child</strong>.</p><p>She became the first African-American woman to win the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers' Songwriter of the Year award in the Rhythm & Soul category in 2000. She released an EP, Fly Above, October 29, 2009, after a hiatus and a full-album, Kandi Koated, under Asylum Records, which she signed with in December 2009 after the deal with Capitol Records fell through, on December 14, 2010. She once teamed up with Atlanta rapper <strong>Rasheeda</strong> and formed <strong>Peach Candy</strong>, releasing PeachCandy EP with a five-track lineup on iTunes. Oh, she'd also launched her own independent label, Kandi Coated Entertainment, in line with her Kandi Coated Cosmetics line.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rasheeda-Frost-Kandi-Burruss.jpg alt="Kandi Burruss and Rasheeda Frost" width=450 height=348 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Rasheeda Frost is Burruss's longtime "sister/friend".</strong><br><strong>Photo Source: BET</strong></p><p>Her writing-credited list includes other songs for <strong>Ariana Grande</strong>, TLC, <strong>Alicia Keys</strong>, <strong>Sam Salter</strong>, <strong>Whitney Houston</strong>, <strong>Ed Sheeran</strong>, and <strong>Mariah Carey</strong>, among others. Interestingly, her credits for Sheeran's Shape of You was given after the pre-chorus line from his song was compared over and over again to TLC's No Scrubs. Kandi, She'kspere and Tameka <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">got the credits</a>.</p><p>Another incident came when she wrote and produced a song for former The Real Housewives of Atlanta co-star <strong>Kim Zolciak-Biermann</strong> called Tardy for the Party. She and collaborating songwriter/producer <strong>Rodney</strong> "<strong>Don Vito</strong>" <strong>Richard</strong> filed a lawsuit against Zolciak for the profits earned from the song. Another RHOA castmate <strong>Phaedra Parks</strong> was her lawyers, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the lawsuit was dismissed</a> after there was not enough evidence of copyright infringement.</p><h2>Spending on Houses More Often?</h2><p>Main Article:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Kandi Burruss House & Real Estate Details</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>More Than Just a Housewife</h2><p>For the second season of The Real Housewives of Atlanta in 2009, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was announced</a> that Kandi Burrus was joining the crew as <strong>DeShawn Snow</strong> made way for her. She was already a mother to <strong>Riley Burruss</strong> [born August 22, 2002] with ex-boyfriend <strong>Russell </strong>"<strong>Block</strong>"<strong> Spencer</strong> of Block Entertainment. But when joining the crew, she'd been dating <strong>Ashley </strong>"<strong>A.J.</strong>" <strong>Jewell</strong> since late 2008 and engaged since January 2009.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-85786718-600x821-1.jpg alt="Kandi Burruss and ex-fiance Ashley Jewell attend the album release party for New Jack City II at Aquaknox Atlanta on April 2, 2009, in Atlanta." width=450 height=615 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>A.J. was not approved by Burruss's mother, Joyce.</strong><br><strong>Photo Credit: Prince Williams, Getty Images</strong></p><p>Burruss's mother disproved of the relationship as he often made appearances on the Bravo TV reality series. But on October 2, 2009, his death left her stunned and speechless. It turned out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he'd sustained a devastating head injury</a> from a brawl with one <strong>Fredrick Richardson</strong> in the parking lot of an Atlanta strip club, the Body Tap Club.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span> <span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span><p>Almost two years later in 2011, she started dating again but in secret. The relationship became known <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when Burruss announced</a> on Twitter on January 15, 2013, that she was engaged to <strong>Todd Tucker</strong>, a former line producer for RHOA. She'd been dating him when filming the fourth season.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2016-12-08-at-6.14.40-PM.png alt="Kandi Burruss with son Ace in the promotional picture for his own Lifestyle brand." width=450 height=449 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Burruss also adds up her net worth by creating brands for her own kids; this one is 'Raising Ace' for son Ace.</strong><br><strong>Photo Source: Raising Ace</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><p>The two got married on April 4, 2014, in a small ceremony in Atlanta. The five-part wedding mini-series, Kandi's Wedding, aired since July 1, 2014, on the Bravo cable network. Again, interestingly, it was the fourth RHOA spin-off, with Don't Be Tardy (for the Wedding) for Zolciak's wedding being the first one. The second one, The Kandi Factory, starred Kandi, following the lives of her and her record producers in launching the careers of undiscovered artists. It was canceled after one season. The third spin-off was for <strong>NeNe Leakes</strong>' [<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth: <strong>$14 million</strong></a>] wedding, called I Dream of NeNe: The Wedding. The ratings for Kandi's Wedding topped the success for all other spin-offs.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>A three-part special, Kandi's Ski Trip, was also released after RHOA Season 7.

Their second child, daughter, <strong>Blaze Tucker</strong>, was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">born via a surrogate</a> on November 22, 2019. The family now lives in the Atlanta mansion that she bought for <strong>$512,000</strong>, back in 2012.</p><h2>RHOA Salary Variation and Other Ventures</h2><p>It's not strange that she's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">isn't afraid to drop some dough</a> on luxuries, but the earnings from several different paths than just music will provide you with the luxury to do so. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, she earns a salary of <strong>$450,000</strong> per season and was, at one point, the highest paid housewife across the Bravo TV franchise with <strong>$550,000</strong> per season. It's still greater than what <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">newer housewives get paid</a>.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/83773347_197388264790051_8486070883690204282_n.jpg alt="Kandi Burruss Net Worth Wallpaper." width=450 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Despite being the richest RHOA housewife in Net Worth, her salary is still less than NeNe Leakes.</strong><br><strong>Photo Source: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kandi Burruss, Instagram</strong></a></p><p>Meanwhile, many gossip sites have claimed she earned more than just <strong>$450,000</strong> per season. The claims reach as high as <strong>$2.3 million</strong> for Season 12, up from <strong>$2.2 million</strong> for Season 11, which is still less than what Leakes was claimed to have made. The salary increment may have been calculations, including the earnings the stars get after several other endorsement and sponsorship deals they get following their appearance every year. In fact, with 7.5 million followers, she makes around <strong>$20,000</strong> per post through sponsorships on Instagram alone. And she's posted over 8000 times.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span> <span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span><p>It's worth mentioning that she appeared on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in February 2010 as a celebrity partner and helped a housewife win <strong>$1 million</strong>.
