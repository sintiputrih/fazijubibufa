The Arkansas native underwent quadruple bypass surgery in 2004 at the age of 58. The four-hour procedure took place after Bill checked himself into New York Presbyterian Hospital due to chest pains and shortness of breath. His surgical team, led by Dr. Craig R. Smith, later confirmed that there were blockages in Bill’s heart at over 90%&nbsp; along with major signs of heart disease. In 2010, Bill underwent another surgery to have stents inserted after chest discomfort.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5BvZqGhnKGus8WMnKOipqSku26vx56jrJ2RYsOqv8itZJuhnKF6qbvSqaCtmZxivam706iqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./for-kathleen-madigan-comedy-is-a-job-first-and-art-second-html.html><span>←</span><span>For Kathleen Madigan, Comedy Is a Job First and Art Second</span></a>
