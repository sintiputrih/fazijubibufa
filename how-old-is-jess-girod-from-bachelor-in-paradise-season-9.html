While Jess is one of the younger women, she is mature, knows what she wants in a partner and doesn’t want to settle for anything less than her soul mate. Jess describes herself as a hopeless romantic and is ready for her fairytale romance worthy of a Taylor Swift love song. Jess comes from a big Puerto Rican family and hopes Zach is ready for her to spice up his life. Jess hopes Zach is as excited about her as she is about him!”</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=138 data-injectable=false>Although Jess was eliminated in week six on The Bachelor, she is back and better than ever, hitting the beach for a second chance at love.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>As mentioned, “Jess is one of the younger women,” however, that did not stop her from sparking up a connection with Blake Moynes, the 33-year-old from season 16 and season 17 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bachelorette</a> (and ex-fiancé of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katie Thurston</a>), in Paradise.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=732 data-injectable=true>With <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean McLaughlin</a> trying time and time again to pursue a relationship with Jess, using the fact that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they’re both Swifties</a> as a means of flirting, he was ultimately unsuccessful. If that does not prove that Jess and Blake are a strong couple that can withstand anything (even a Ken doll look-alike), we don’t know what does!</p><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=133 data-injectable=false>Due to the rather large age gap between Jess and Blake, fans of The Bachelor franchise have just one question: How old is Jess Girod?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-old-is-jess-girod-from-bachelor-in-paradise-season-9 data-injectable=false>How old is Jess Girod from Bachelor In Paradise season 9?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true><a title=@jessicagirodd href=#>@jessicagirodd</a><p>But they complain about casting 24 year olds <a title=bachelorinparadise href=#>#bachelorinparadise</a></p><a title="♬ Theme From Jeopardy! - Think Music - TV Sounds Unlimited" href=#>♬ Theme From Jeopardy! – Think Music – TV Sounds Unlimited</a></figure><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>Born on February 16, 1999, Jess is just 24 years of age — she is truly the baby of Paradise!</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Given her age, she has received quite a bit of backlash from Bachelor Nation fans, accusing her of being too young for marriage. Fortunately, the Florida native lets the haters roll off of her back, taking to TikTok to share why being on the younger side is actually a good thing.</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=796 data-injectable=true>On September 29, 2023, Jess posted a silly TikTok video of her “teaching millennials how to use social media,” featuring clips of fellow Bachelor In Paradise contestants <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mercedes Northup</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylee Russell</a> fiddling with their cell phones with a confused expression. To top it all off, she captioned the post, “But they complain about casting 24 year olds&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">#bachelorinparadise</a>” — how funny is that?</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>The official Bachelor In Paradise TikTok account even commented on the video, sharing that Jess is “doing the lord’s work” by giving Mercedes and Kylee a social media tutorial.
