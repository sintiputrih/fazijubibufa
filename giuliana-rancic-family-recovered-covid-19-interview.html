I adore my family, and Duke is at the great age of eight hat we are silly and laugh every day, no matter what we are doing,” Giuliana said. “I have been able to be very productive from home, I spend a good deal of my work day on running the day-to-day on my skincare line Fountain of Truth as well as my clothing line G by Giuliana on HSN and my home decor line August & Leo, also on HSN. I’ve been fortunate in that I converted my home office into a small studio that allows me to be live on HSN each week with my new collections in both fashion and home.” Working mom goals!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>On October 8th, Giuliana, along with her husband Bill and special guests<strong> Lauren</strong> and <strong>Jason Kennedy,&nbsp;Kendra Scott</strong>, will host the&nbsp;<span lang=en><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>The Pink Agenda</b></a>‘s Virtual Gala. “</span>I look forward to The Pink Agenda’s Gala every year, and while I wish we could be together in New York, I am beyond thrilled that we are still able to come together during these challenging times,” G explained of the nonprofit committed to raising money for breast cancer research and care, as well as awareness of the disease among young professionals. “While I will miss seeing everyone in person, I am grateful that we can gather virtually during breast cancer awareness month and raise critical funds for my FAB-U-WISH program, where we grant wishes to those going through breast cancer, and funding lifesaving cancer research.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/giuliana-rancic-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Giuliana has outspoken about the importance of breast cancer research and early detection since she was diagnosed herself in 2011 at the age of 36. At that age, the popular E! News host was four years away from the age when breast cancer screening is usually recommended for most women, who are not at high risk for cancer. Her foundation, “Fab-U-Wish,” helps women with breast cancer look and feel their best while also supporting groundbreaking research.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Breast cancer hasn’t stopped for COVID-19 and neither can we. Raising money for breast cancer research is critical, now more than ever,” Giuliana urged. “We’ve seen amazing research progress over the years, but we need to sustain these advancements through the challenging times, and until we grant our ultimate wish – finding a cure for breast cancer. We need to save cancer research today to save lives tomorrow.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><span lang=en>Guests can purchase tickets to receive event access here: <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tpagala.org</a> and visit </span><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><span lang=en>The Pink Agenda</span></a><span lang=en> for more information.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5xe49xZqChpaG2orrAZqmappOesG6ywKagpbFdp7Kku9WeqZ6cXZi8t7XDZmhyZZmjwaa%2B1aKcsGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shiny-frillish.html><span>←</span><span>Can Frillish Be Shiny In Pokmon GO Valentines Day Event</span></a>
