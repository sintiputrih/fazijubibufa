Her fanbase loves how open she is in her song lyrics. However, <a href=#>Taylor Swift is a billionaire now</a>, and that means that she does opt for luxury sometimes. One example? She has two private jets. As it turns out, Taylor Swift was the focus of a controversy involving her private jet flights, and there is even a conspiracy theory as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inside-taylor-swift-39-s-private-jet-controversy>Inside Taylor Swift's Private Jet Controversy</h2><p>In 2022, Buzzfeed reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift flew via private jet a lot</a>. In fact, she traveled this way so often that Buzzfeed said that she "racked up more emissions on her own in just seven months than 1,184 average people would put out in a year." This information came from research that Yard did, and the study says that <strong>Taylor Swift was at the top of the list for C02 emissions</strong>.</p><p>People were upset to hear this because, as Yard found out, Swift often flew for just 80 minutes. She even took a flight to Nashville from Missouri that lasted 36 minutes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-11.jpg><p>According to Billboard, Yard looked at Celeb Jets, which is a Twitter account, to figure out which stars were flying private the most.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/are_taylor_swift_s_parents_on_speaking_terms__720.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Are Taylor Swift's Parents On Speaking Terms?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Despite frequently gushing about their daughter, Scott and Andrea Swift have remained notoriously tight-lipped about their relationship.</span><p>Buzzfeed reported that Taylor Swift has two private jets and that they "took 170 flights in a mere 200 days."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Some of Yard's findings about Taylor Swift flying via private jet (according to Buzzfeed)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Someone's typical annual C02 emissions: 7 metric tons</strong></li><li><strong>Taylor Swift's private jet C02 emissions in 2022: 8,293.54 metric tons</strong></li></ul><p>As many have pointed out, C02 emissions are terrible for the environment, and that is where the concern comes from.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p><strong>The Celebrities Who Flew Private The Most In 2022 (According to Yard)</strong></p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>10: Travis Scott: 3033.3 tonnes of CO2e</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9: Oprah Winfrey: 3,493.17 (68 flights)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>8: Mark Wahlberg: 3772.85 tonnes (101 flights)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7: Kim Kardashian: 4268.5 tonnes (57 flights)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>6: Steven Spielberg: 4,465 tonnes (61 flights)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5: Blake Shelton: 4495 tonnes (111 flights)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4: Alex Rodriguez: 5,342.7 tonnes (106 flights)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3: Jay-Z: 6,981.3 tonnes (136 flights)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2: Floyd Mayweather: 7,076.8 tonnes (177 flights)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1: Taylor Swift: 8,293.54 tonnes (170 flights)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/was-taylor-swift-s-eras-merch-worth-it-despite-it-s-insane-price_.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/your-paragraph-text-2023-11-04t101009-305.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift Handled The Boos At Her Friend's Wedding In The Best Way Possible</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift was booed by her own fans at her friend's wedding, but handled it all the right way.</span><p>Several Taylor Swift fans discussed the private jet problem on Reddit. In one thread, Redditor @Fleetwood_Spac wrote:</p><p>"Yeah this definitely deserves criticism. If your lifestyle requires you to fly private jets this much then you need to change your lifestyle because our planet literally can’t sustain it. Really makes me sad and I hope she starts taking this seriously at some point."</p><p>Redditor @mycatisperfect agreed and wrote, "This is very shocking to me, honestly. More and more celebs are emphasizing the importance of reducing emissions, but it’s these outrageous overconsumptions that need to be curbed. I love Taylor, but I’d never take a statement from her about the climate seriously after seeing this. I really think she has the means to do better."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As another fan shared in another Reddit thread, while it might be tough for Swift to take a commercial plane ride because of her fame, it still seems over-the-top to have not just one private jet but two.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/despite-the-success-of-the-eras-tour-taylor-swift-wasn-t-immune-to-forgetting-the-lyrics-of-her-songs.jpg><p>In August 2022, The Daily Mail reported on the official statement regarding Taylor Swift using private jets.

One reason why it could have started? The fact that Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift haven't come out and said that they are officially in a relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-swift.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The Blast, when Kelce posted a photo of himself on Instagram and wrote "Keep it chill like Sauvignon Blanc" in the caption, fans thought he was referring to Swift since she's a fan of white wine. But, of course, that doesn't mean that he said that they are definitely dating.</p><p>While fans have been waiting for the stars to say that they are seeing each other, sources continue to tell various publications that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelce and Swift seem to be going strong</a>. In November 2023, Us Weekly reported that Kelce could go to South America when Swift performs there as part of her extended Eras tour.</p><p>A source told Us Weekly, “Travis and Taylor are a very real couple, they actually spend a lot of one-on-one time together and have developed a very real connection. They have very detailed plans coming up on how to stay together while she’s on tour and he has games.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina2rXaW%2FqsLArZxmopWpera%2FwKCcZpqRmLitrdKhZJynnqi9qr7AnLBmrJiavLO1xKxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pookie-loc-real-name-death-and-biography-who-was-jeezys-friend-pookie-loc.html><span>←</span><span>Pookie Loc Real Name, Death, And Biography, Who Was Jeezys Friend Pookie Loc?</span></a>
