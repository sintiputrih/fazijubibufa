Palpitoad was angered by their intrusion, and ordered his Tympole cohorts to attack them. When they swam away in fear of Oshawott, he called upon his friend, <a href=# title="Cilan's Stunfisk">Stunfisk</a>'s, help. However, when Cilan fished Stunfisk out of the water, Palpitoad was forced to face Oshawott himself. Despite knowing some powerful moves, the Vibration Pokémon lost to Oshawott's newly mastered <a href=# title="Aqua Jet (move)">Aqua Jet</a>, and was caught by Ash.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=BW039>Reunion Battles In Nimbasa!</a></i>, he was used in the <a href=# title="Club Battle">Club Battle</a> Tournament against <a href=# title=Burgundy>Burgundy</a>'s <a href=# title="Stoutland (Pokémon)">Stoutland</a>. Despite being his first battle with Ash as his Trainer, the two synchronized well, avoiding Stoutland's attacks and dealing out powerful blows. Eventually, Palpitoad was caught in Stoutland's mouth when it used <a href=# title="Thunder Fang (move)">Thunder Fang</a>, though he avoided damage from the <a href=# title="Electric (type)">Electric-type</a> move, being part <a href=# title="Ground (type)">Ground-type</a>. However, Burgundy took the chance, and ordered an <a href=# title="Ice Fang (move)">Ice Fang</a> attack, which became a problem for Palpitoad until he used Supersonic to shatter the ice, and knock Stoutland back. After blocking Stoutland's <a href=# title="Fire Fang (move)">Fire Fang</a> with Mud Shot, Palpitoad won the match with a direct hit from Hydro Pump. In <i><a href=# title=BW042>Club Battle Finale: A Hero's Outcome!</a></i>, Palpitoad battled <a href=# title=Dino>Dino</a>'s <a href=# title="Darumaka (Pokémon)">Darumaka</a> in the semifinals and won with a single Hydro Pump, allowing Ash to move on to the finals.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/16/Ash_Palpitoad_vs_Elesa_Zebstrika.png/375px-Ash_Palpitoad_vs_Elesa_Zebstrika.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Palpitoad vs Zebstrika<p>In <i><a href=# title=BW050>Dazzling the Nimbasa Gym!</a></i>, Palpitoad was used in Ash's Gym battle against Elesa. Being immune to <a href=# title="Electric (type)">Electric-type</a> moves, Palpitoad was the ideal choice for this battle, and was Ash's sole strategy. Palpitoad took many ineffective hits from Zebstrika's <a href=# title="Flame Charge (move)">Flame Charge</a> and a <a href=# title="Double Kick (move)">Double Kick</a> attack, proving unable to dodge. As Zebstrika headed towards Palpitoad using <a href=# title="Quick Attack (move)">Quick Attack</a>, Ash commanded a Supersonic attack, which blocked and confused Zebstrika. Palpitoad then finished the match with a Mud Shot, followed by a Hydro Pump. Palpitoad showed signs of fatigue after Elesa recalled Zebstrika, so both Iris and Cilan suggested that Ash should recall him and switch to another Pokémon. Ash, however, decided to stick with Palpitoad when Elesa brought out <a href=# title="Emolga (Pokémon)">Emolga</a>. However, Palpitoad found himself unable to keep up with Emolga's fast moves, and was hit by an <a href=# title="Acrobatics (move)">Acrobatics</a> attack, and several <a href=# title="Aerial Ace (move)">Aerial Ace</a> attacks before he was hit with Emolga's <a href=# title="Attract (move)">Attract</a>, causing him to become immobilized by infatuation. After another couple more hits from Aerial Ace, Palpitoad was knocked out, ruining Ash's strategy for the battle, but Ash later regained his composure and won.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/a3/Ash_and_Palpitoad.png/375px-Ash_and_Palpitoad.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Palpitoad and Ash<p>In <i><a href=# title=BW084>Rocking the Virbank Gym! Part 2</a></i>, Ash used Palpitoad as his fifth Pokémon during his Gym battle against <a href=# title=Roxie>Roxie</a> and her final and strongest Pokémon, <a href=# title="Garbodor (Pokémon)">Garbodor</a>. Palpitoad first tried to use Mud Shot on the Trash Heap Pokémon, but Garbodor used its extendable arms to raise itself from the floor and dodge the attack. As Garbodor attacked with <a href=# title="Hyper Beam (move)">Hyper Beam</a>, Palpitoad used Hydro Pump to block it. Palpitoad then tried another Mud Shot, but it was blocked and countered by a <a href=# title="Gunk Shot (move)">Gunk Shot</a> attack, which <a href=# title="Poison (status condition)">poisoned</a> Palpitoad as it hit. Garbodor attacked Palpitoad two times with <a href=# title="Venoshock (move)">Venoshock</a>, being twice as powerful because of the poison, and he was knocked out.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=BW106>Strong Strategy Steals the Show!</a></i>, Ash used Palpitoad in his <a href=# title="Vertress Conference">Vertress Conference</a> battle against <a href=# title=Stephan>Stephan</a> and his Zebstrika. At the beginning of the battle Zebstrika was too fast for Palpitoad and avoided its Mud Shot before striking back with <a href=# title="Double-Edge (move)">Double-Edge</a> and <a href=# title="Stomp (move)">Stomp</a>. However, Palpitoad was shown to have learned a new move, Sludge Wave, which caused Zebstrika to become poisoned when the attack hit. Despite this, Zebstrika was able to fight back, even using the poison as an advantage when using <a href=# title="Facade (move)">Facade</a>, which did a lot of damage to Palpitoad. Ultimately Palpitoad managed to hit Zebstrika with Supersonic, causing it to damage itself due to confusion. Palpitoad then managed to launch a hit with Hydro Pump. Stephan in turn ordered a Giga Impact which sent Palpitoad flying. However, Palpitoad managed to fire a Mud Shot while in the air just before crashing into a wall, fainting. The match ended with a tie as Zebstrika fainted at the same time from the Mud Shot Palpitoad managed to execute.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/2/22/Goh_meeting_Gible_and_Palpitoad.png/375px-Goh_meeting_Gible_and_Palpitoad.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Palpitoad meeting Goh<p>In <i><a href=# title=BW123>Farewell, Unova!

Palpitoad is also very protective over what he claims as his own, such as territory, as shown in the same instance. In the <a href=# title="Club Battle">Club Battle</a> Tournament, Palpitoad was revealed to be capable of putting up a strong fight against his opponents. Since he shares a love for battling with Ash, Palpitoad seems satisfied to have Ash as his Trainer, and they were able to work well together, despite only recently being caught at the time and the tournament being the first battle Palpitoad participated in with his Trainer. Palpitoad is also physically tough, as he can endure attacks easily as shown in the Gym battle with <a href=# title=Elesa>Elesa</a> and in the battle against <a href=# title=Stephan>Stephan</a>.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Moves_used>Moves used</span></h2><table class=roundy><tbody readability=1.7234042553191><tr readability=0.62559241706161><td><table><tbody><tr><td class=roundy><table class=roundy><tbody><tr><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="Ash Palpitoad Sludge Wave 1.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/9/9d/Ash_Palpitoad_Sludge_Wave_1.png/300px-Ash_Palpitoad_Sludge_Wave_1.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td></tr><tr><td align=center>Using Sludge Wave</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td class=roundy></td></tr><tr readability=4><td colspan=2 class=roundy>A <b><span>†</span></b> shows that the move was used recently, unless all moves fit this case or there are fewer than five known moves.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Moves_improvised>Moves improvised</span></h3><table><tbody readability=7.8333333333333><tr><th><span>Picture</span></th><th><span>First Used In</span></th><th><span>Moves Involved</span></th><th><span>Partnered With</span></th></tr><tr readability=2.980198019802><td rowspan=2><a href=# class=image><img alt="Ash BW Team combination attack.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/3/30/Ash_BW_Team_combination_attack.png/225px-Ash_BW_Team_combination_attack.png decoding=async width=150 height=84 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><i><a href=# title=BW142>The Dream Continues!</a></i></td><td><a href=# title="Thunderbolt (move)">Thunderbolt</a>, <a href=# title="Flamethrower (move)">Flamethrower</a>, <a href=# title="Leaf Storm (move)">Leaf Storm</a>, <a href=# title="Hydro Pump (move)">Hydro Pump</a>, <a href=# title="Air Cutter (move)">Air Cutter</a>, <a href=# title="Focus Blast (move)">Focus Blast</a>, <a href=# title="Energy Ball (move)">Energy Ball</a>, <a href=# title="Flash Cannon (move)">Flash Cannon</a>, <a href=# title="Mud Shot (move)">Mud Shot</a>, and <a href=# title="Stone Edge (move)">Stone Edge</a></td><td>Ash's rotation for <i><a href=# title="Pokémon the Series: Black & White">Pokémon the Series: Black & White</a></i></td></tr><tr readability=9.2620865139949><td colspan=3><b>Description:</b> Palpitoad combines his Mud Shot with a joint Flamethrower from <a href=# title="Ash's Pignite">Pignite</a> and <a href=# title="Ash's Charizard">Charizard</a>, <a href=# title="Ash's Snivy">Snivy</a>'s Leaf Storm, <a href=# title="Ash's Oshawott">Oshawott</a>'s Hydro Pump, <a href=# title="Ash's Unfezant">Unfezant</a>'s Air Cutter, <a href=# title="Ash's Scraggy">Scraggy</a>'s Focus Blast, <a href=# title="Ash's Leavanny">Leavanny</a>'s Energy Ball, <a href=# title="Ash's Boldore">Boldore</a>'s Flash Cannon, <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a>'s Thunderbolt, and <a href=# title="Ash's Krookodile">Krookodile</a>'s Stone Edge to create a gigantic blast of energy.
