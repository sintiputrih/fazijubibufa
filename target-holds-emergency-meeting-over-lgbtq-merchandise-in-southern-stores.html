This year it is just exponentially more than any other year,” the Target insider continued. “I think given the current situation with Bud Light, the company is terrified of a Bud Light situation.”&nbsp;</p><p>The insider, who has worked at the retailer for almost two decades, said Target rarely makes such hasty decisions. They said Friday’s call began with roughly 10 minutes on “how to deal with team member safety” because of the amount of backlash the Pride merchandise has generated, noting that Target Asset Protect & Corporate Security teams were present on the call.&nbsp;</p><p>“The call was super quick, it was 15 minutes. The first 10 minutes was about how to keep your team safe and not having to advocate for Target. The last five was, ‘Move this to the back, take down the mannequins and remove the signage,’” the insider said, noting that bathing suits have replaced Pride merchandise in front-of-store displays despite Pride month not even starting until June 1.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s all under the guise of trying to increase swim sales,” the insider said. “Everyone was like, ‘Thank God,’ because we’re all on the front lines dealing with it.”&nbsp;</p><p>Target did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Fox News Digital has confirmed rural Target stores in South Carolina, Arkansas and Georgia are among the locations to move the Pride sections. Most rank-and-file employees were left in the dark, with many not knowing the Pride sections would be moved until they noticed it themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Pride merchandise remains prominently displayed at other locations and on the Target website. &nbsp;</p><p>Target Pride merchandise includes female-style swimsuits that can be used to “tuck” male genitalia. Some products are also labeled as “Thoughtfully fit on multiple body types and gender expressions.”&nbsp;</p><p>Pride merchandise also includes onesies and rompers for newborn babies, a variety of adult clothing with slogans such as “Super Queer,” party supplies, home décor, multiple books and a “Grow At Your Own Pace” saucer planter.&nbsp;</p><p>Bud Light sales have plummeted since&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">backlash to the infamous partnership</a>&nbsp;with transgender activist&nbsp;Dylan Mulvaney continues to haunt the company more than a month since it came to light.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Pride merchandise also includes onesies and rompers for newborn babies. <span class=credit>Target</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Fox News Digital has confirmed rural Target stores in South Carolina, Arkansas and Georgia are among the locations to move the Pride sections. <span class=credit>ZUMAPRESS.com</span></figure><p>The issue began when Mulvaney publicized that the&nbsp;beer company&nbsp;sent packs of Bud Light featuring the influencer’s face as a way to celebrate a full year of “girlhood.”</p><p>Mulvaney is one of many social media influencers Bud Light has tapped to promote the brand.</p><p>Mulvaney said the cans were her “most prized possession” on Instagram with a post that featured “#budlightpartner.” A video then featured Mulvaney in a bathtub drinking a Bud Light beer as part of the campaign. Some consumers mistakenly thought the cans with Mulvaney’s face were being sold to the public.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A Target insider said there were “emergency” calls on Friday and some managers and district senior directors were told to tamp down the Pride sections immediately.&nbsp; <span class=credit>Target</span></figure><p>“Bud Light learned an important lesson about wading into the culture wars recently.
