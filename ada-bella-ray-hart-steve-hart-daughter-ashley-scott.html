<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Meet Ada Bella Ray Hart Photos Of Steve Harts Daughter With Wife Ashley Scott</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Ashley Scott</strong> is a really talented actress known for roles in Jumanji: The Next Level, UnReal, Just Friends, and many more. She was previously married to actor <strong>Anthony Rhulen</strong> from 2004 to 2008. After her sad breakup with her ex-partner, she quickly recovered and started dating <strong>Steve Hart</strong>. They started dating since October of 2008, and after dating for two years, they finally tied their knot back in January of 2010. The lovely duo shares two daughters together, <strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Iyla Vue Hart</a>&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>Ada Bella Ray Hart</strong>.</p><p>Ashley Scott’s daughter, Ada Bella Ray Hart, was born on January 6, 2010. Speaking of her father Steve, he is an English singer and actor who also happens to be the lead vocalist of the band, World Apart. She also has a younger sister named Iyla Vue, and she takes excellent care of her sibling. In fact, both the sisters’ duo share a lovely bond and love spending time playing with one another.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sisters_Duo_Love_Father_Steve></span>Sisters’ Duo, Love Father Steve<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The lovely pair of Ashley and Steve share two lovely and beautiful daughters. They say sisters are different flowers that grow in the same garden, and elder sisters are the second mother. Similar to that, Ada is like a mother figure to her little sister Iyla. She guides her little sister in every step of her life, including reading and writing too. Both the sisters’ duo can be seen playing with their handsome dad either in the park or sometimes at the beach.</p><p>Furthermore, Steve Hart’s daughter Ada Belle Ray Hart adores her father’s company. Both the father-daughter can be seen having <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">date nights</a>. Not only do they have date nights, but they also have a delightful day time where they like to ride bikes, scooters, and have lunch beside the Venice beach. Every day is a new day with dad Steve and every new day brings a new flow of positive vibes and excitement. Ada’s father, Steve loves taking his two daughters out with him. He says there is nothing better than spending time with his two little angels.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mama_Ashley></span>Mama Ashley<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ashley Scott’s daughter Ada Belle Ray Hart, is as beautiful as her mother. In fact, she has inherited her mother’s good looks ignoring her mother’s blond hair. Maybe that part she has acquired from her father, Steve. Either way, she is charming and adorable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Steve-Hart-daughter.jpg><p>Ashley loves sharing pictures of her Hart family and it’s always a treat. Plus, the captions she writes are heartwarming. One of Ada’s mother’s captions meant Darkness can’t kill darkness only light can so, help light up the world one smile at a time. Ada’s parents are involved in a project called Operation Smile, whose main aim is to make every child smile in the world. Well, her parents are trying to make the world a better place, and we hope she grows up to become just like her parents, successful as well as light-hearted.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ada_Belle_Ray_Hart_Name_Meaning></span>Ada Belle Ray Hart Name Meaning<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Steve Hart’s daughter Ada Belle Ray Hart’s first name Ada is of German origin, meaning nobility, but it also has a Hebrew origin meaning adornment.
