She’s a sweet girl who is super low-maintenance, so we wanted to completely surprise her with an epic trip to New York City. &nbsp;And of course, the majority of the trip revolved around food. Duh, I am a food blogger for a reason!</p><p>My kids LOVE food too but my this daughter is a real health nut and chooses her sweets carefully. However, a visit to Levain Bakery was high on the list for this girl.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Levain-Bakery-Dark-Chocolate-Peanut-Butter-Chip-Cookies-1.jpg alt="Chocolate Peanut Butter Chip Cookies.

If you’ve never been to Levain Bakery, you would be amazed to see how tiny the storefront is for this very popular bakery. The day we arrived, our time was limited so we couldn’t brave the line. But there was always the next day and we were determined! We had to exercise some serious patience!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Levain-Bakery-Dark-Chocolate-Peanut-Butter-Chip-Cookies-2.jpg alt="Chocolate Peanut Butter Chip Cookies.

Hallelujah! We purchased our Chocolate Chip and Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Chip Cookies, which by the way cost $4 each, and sat on the bench and devoured them. I must have studied the cookies for what seemed like forever to my kids, who just wanted to take a bite of them for the very first time. I had to remind them it’s all about the research!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC_0454ed2.jpg alt="Levain Bakery Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Chip Cookies by Modern Honey l www.modernhoney.com" width=3693 height=2693 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>My kids have been taught to be brutally honest about food because they are my ultimate taste testers.

Where are my Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie fanatics?</p><p>The fascinating thing about Levain Bakery cookies is their ability to be thick without being cakey. If you read my other Levain Bakery copycat cookie post, you will know that those cookies are my husband’s favorite cookie of all time. I think the reason is that they aren’t over the top sweet. They are rich and decadent without putting you into a sugar coma.</p><p>If you are a true chocoholic, you can substitute peanut butter chips for dark, semisweet or milk chocolate chunks, which will give you a true <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Levain Bakery Dark Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookie copycat recipe</strong></a>. You are getting 2 for 1 here, people.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC_0459ed.jpg alt="Levain Bakery Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Chip Cookies by Modern Honey l www.modernhoney.com" width=2922 height=2696 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>How to make Levain Bakery Chocolate Peanut Butter Copycat Cookies:</strong></h2><li>&nbsp;<strong>Use cold butter</strong>. Now, I am not talking about throwing two cubes of cold butter into the mixer and hoping the butter will incorporate into the sugars. Nope. The key is to cut the butter with a knife into small cubes, making it easier to cream with the sugar. We want them to become one and meld together to break down the graininess of the sugar. Cream for at least 4 minutes on high until light and fluffy.</li><li><strong>Use good high-quality cocoa</strong>, if at all possible. Levain uses dark cocoa for these cookies. If you can find that in your grocery stores, use it! Hershey’s makes a dark chocolate cocoa that would be fantastic. If you follow me at all, you know I am a huge fan of Callebaut cocoa. It’s found in the bulk bin section at Winco and is very reasonable. I wish it was as cheap on Amazon as it is at Winco. Trader Joe’s also makes a fabulous baking cocoa.</li><li><strong>Use a mix of cake flour and all-purpose flour</strong>. Why cake flour? You know how I talked about Levain being a thick cookie without tasting like a scone? When you use cake flour, it creates a more TENDER crumb on the cookie which creates a mouth-watering texture.</li><li><strong>Another game changer is</strong> <strong>cornstarch</strong>. It also helps to create and soft and tender cookie.</li><li><strong>Bake at high heat</strong>. You want to shock these Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Chip Cookies with high heat so they don’t spread too rapidly. It helps keep their shape and make those crispy edges. These are my favorite silpats — <strong><a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B00008T960 data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>Silpat Brand</a> and <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B00V5IM0EU data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>Amazon Basics</a>.</strong></li><h3>Here are more famous Levain Bakery cookie recipes:</h3><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=2068 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/levain-bakery-dark-chocolate-peanut-butter-chip-cookies/>Pin It</a><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=9.5><li id=wprm-recipe-12659-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=-1><p>Preheat oven to 410 degrees.</p></li><li id=wprm-recipe-12659-step-0-1 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=3><p>In a large bowl, cream together cold butter and sugars until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.
