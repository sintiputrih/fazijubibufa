<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Kio Cyr Responds To Austin Mahones Brutality Towards His Girlfriend</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Kio Cyr’s</strong> girlfriend Amanda Diaz released a TikTok video on August 21, 2022, in which she could be seen sitting in a pool chair with her eyes closed while the music played, “I can’t see a darn thing.” The video featured the language overlay “when he is a walking red flag yet has green eyes,” and she typed “guilty” in the description.</p><p>Diaz admitted to having a soft spot for guys with green eyes, even if they were troublesome in a relationship. Many people in the comments were disputing whether or not her partner had green eyes. The video ultimately drew the attention of Austin Mahone, who replied to it. He patched Diaz’s video, flaunted his green eyes in the description, and tagged Diaz, implying that he wouldn’t mind hitting on her. Many people in the comments section informed Diaz that she was already in a relationship. Cyr was even tagged in the video by some.</p><h2>Kio Cyr Reacts to Austin Mahone’s Abuse of His Girlfriend</h2><p>Then, on August 22, 2022, Cyr replied to Mahone banging on his girlfriend. He spliced Mahone’s film together, then cut to him and Diaz in a room. Cyr was propped up on a chair and Diaz was laying on the bed, looking at her phone. He turned to Diaz, then to the camera, and stated, “I chose peace to prevent violence,” with a little giggle, before ending the video by focusing on his displeased and envious expression.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Austin-Mahone.jpg alt="Austin Mahone" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He merely tagged the singer in the caption. Fans were ecstatic by his amusing reply and shared their opinions in the comments area.</p><p>“The arrogance he had Kio, tell him,” one person replied, while another added, “not today @autinmahone, you do not want to annoy Kio.”</p><p>Even Mahone got in on the act, writing in the comments section, “I am a lover too.” Cyr did not respond to him, most likely because his admirers had done so on his behalf. They requested Mahone to step aside and said that Diaz would never pick the singer over her present lover.</p><h2>Austin Mahone claims that everything is OK.</h2><p>Later, Mahone said that everything was OK and that he had no intention of interfering with them. “Everything is OK. “They have a lot more history,” the singer said. There were speculations in July 2022 that Diaz and Cyr had split up after the former uploaded a TikTok with another guy. Diaz was on holiday in Ibiza, Spain, at the time, and Cyr had not joined her.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kio-Cyr.jpg alt="Kio Cyr" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>A guy with tattoos all over his hand offered her bread in the video. Fans assumed there was turmoil in paradise since Cyr did not have tattoos like those. They said Diaz and Cy had broken up, but before things could get out of hand, the former responded to a remark with, “I can have friends.” LMAO.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiioqddmMazedGeqqmnnpnAbsDOZpiuq6Seu265wKGmp52jYq%2BzwdOao6KsqWLBsMPAq5usZZiewG6zyKujn6qZmrulew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-old-is-faze-h1ghsky-find-his-age-height-net-worth-and-real-name.html><span>←</span><span>How Old Is FaZe H1ghSky?
