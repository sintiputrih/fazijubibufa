Now, over 20 years and a few relationships later, both Aniston and Pitt have become winners again at the 26th annual SAG Awards–and they're proving once and for all that there's no bad blood between them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While making her acceptance speech for the Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series for her role on The Morning Show, Brad Pitt was nowhere to be seen. But, in a behind-the-scenes video captured by E!, we find that Pitt, who won the award for Best Male Actor in a Supporting Role just moments before, was watching all along backstage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Boy did we get to dive deep into our own experiences and our own history and really be able to breathe life into these extraordinary characters,” Aniston said while she was accepting her award. “Who knew that emotional breakdowns felt that good? It was literally about seven months of therapy that covered 20 years of work. So thank you for watching that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pitt and Aniston also bumped into each other while backstage, where they exchanged big smiles with each other. He was even snapped grabbing onto Aniston's wrist, which set the Internet into a frenzy.</p><img alt="26th Annual Screen Actors&nbsp;Guild Awards - Media Center" title="26th Annual Screen Actors&nbsp;Guild Awards - Media Center" width=4000 height=2667 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brad-pitt-and-jennifer-aniston-attend-the-26th-annual-news-photo-1579488971.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Emma McIntyre</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pitt won for his performance in Once Upon A Time ... in Hollywood.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
