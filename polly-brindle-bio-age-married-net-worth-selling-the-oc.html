Eleven recent alumni who are luxury waterfront property agents in Orange County, California, are the focus of the curriculum. The cast of “Selling Sunset” The Oppenheim Group, a brokerage run by Jason and Brett Oppenheim, reportedly expanded to cover Newport Beach in 2021, according to the Real Deal. They brought a totally new group of agents with them.</p><p>In addition, Polly is one of the 11 attractive and accomplished agents that will be on the show.</p><p>Alex Hall, Alexandra Rose, Alexandra Jarvis, Austin Victoria, Gio Helou, Kayla Cardona, Brandi Marshall, Tyler Stanaland, Sean Palmieri, and Lauren Brito are some of the other participants on this eight-episode voyage with her.</p><h3><strong>Polly Brindle Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Polly Brindle’s thriving career with a net worth of above $1 million.</p><p>When Polly was spotted as a model in her native England at the age of 15, she began working professionally. She then enjoyed a successful two-decade modeling career that brought her into contact with illustrious companies like Lancôme, Dior, and Aston Martin.</p><p>Because of her line of work, Polly had the opportunity to visit cities like London, Paris, Milan, and Barcelona, which sparked a lifelong passion for architecture and design in her.</p><p>After relocating, Polly began to actively engage in the business and design industries, which aided in the development of her skills.
