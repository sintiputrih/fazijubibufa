Years later I met Kevin Cronin, and thank goodness he’s as great a person as he is a songwriter. This tour won’t just be a great time with great people, but a tour that will have a ton of familiar songs to most generations. I will be wishing I was in the audience as much as I’ll love being on the stage.”</p><p style=font-weight:400>REO Speedwagon’s<strong> Kevin Cronin</strong> said: “Pat Monahan and I have done several benefit shows over the years, and now we get to take out our bands for a summer full of music and fun.

style=font-weight:400>Train is a multi-GRAMMY Award-winning, diamond-selling band from San Francisco that has had 14 songs on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart and 13 albums on the Billboard 200 chart. Train’s climb to the top began in 1994, as the original 5-member band tenaciously built a loyal hometown following, leading up to their debut self-titled album released by Columbia in 1998. The tumbling wordplay of “Meet Virginia” gave them their first unlikely radio hit, and 2001’s Drops of Jupiter broke them to multi-platinum status thanks to the double-GRAMMY-winning title song that spent 10 months in the Top 40, has been certified RIAA 7x platinum, and earned the 2001 GRAMMY Award for Best Rock Song. The group won another GRAMMY in 2011 for their global hit “Hey, Soul Sister” from their multi-platinum album Save Me, San Francisco(2009), which was the No.1 best-selling smash and most downloaded single of 2010, achieved RIAA Diamond status in 2021 and now 11x platinum, and in 2022 surpassed one billion streams on Spotify. Train has sold more than 10 million albums and 30 million tracks worldwide, with multiple platinum/gold citations, including three GRAMMY Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, and dozens of other honors. They’ve had 24 Top 10 songs across the Billboard charts and six Top 10 albums on the Billboard 200 chart including Drops of Jupiter (2001), My Private Nation (2003), California 37(2012), Bulletproof Picasso(2014), For Me, It’s You (2016), and a girl a bottle a boat (2017). Train released their critically acclaimed 11th studio album, AM Gold, in May 2022 and most recently released a new song “I Know” ft. Tenille Townes and Bryce Vine, which marked their 27th career entry on Billboard’s Adult Pop Airplay chart.</p><p style=font-weight:400>Train frontman, <strong>Pat Monahan</strong>, partakes in other ventures outside of music, including his award-winning wine portfolio, Save Me, San Francisco Wine Co, which was created in 2011 and has sold over 10 million bottles and won over 100 medals. Proceeds from his wine business support Family House, a San Francisco charity that supports families of children with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses.  Monahan has appeared on television and in film with credits that include the 2021 Hallmark Channel original movie, Christmas in Tahoe, inspired by Train’s album of the same name, which he executive produced and starred, Dr. Ken, 90210, CBS’s Hawaii Five-0 and Magnum P.I., The Voice, American Idol, and The Bachelor.</p><p style=font-weight:400;text-align:center><strong>Connect with Train:</strong></p><p style=font-weight:400;text-align:center><a href=#>Website</a> | <a href=#>Instagram</a> | <a href=#>Facebook</a> | <a href=#>X</a> | <a href=#>TikTok</a></p><p style=font-weight:400><strong><u>About REO Speedwagon</u></strong></p><p style=font-weight:400>Formed in 1967, signed in 1971, and fronted by iconic vocalist Kevin Cronin since 1972, REO Speedwagon’s unrelenting drive, as well as non-stop touring and recording jump-started the burgeoning rock movement in the Midwest. Platinum albums and radio staples soon followed, setting the stage for the release of the band’s explosive Hi Infidelity in 1980, which contained the massive hit singles “Keep On Loving You” and “Take It On the Run.” That landmark album spent 15 weeks in the No. 1 slot and has since earned the RIAA’s coveted 10X Diamond Award for surpassing sales of 10 million units in the United States.</p><p style=font-weight:400>From 1977 to 1989, REO Speedwagon released nine consecutive albums all certified Platinum or higher. To date, REO Speedwagon has sold more than 40 million albums around the globe, and Cronin and bandmates Bruce Hall, Dave Amato, Bryan Hitt, Derek Hilland, and most recent addition Matt Bissonette, are electrifying audiences worldwide in concert with hits and fan-favorites such as “Ridin’ The Storm Out,” “Can’t Fight This Feeling,” “Time For Me To Fly,” “Roll With The Changes,” “Keep On Loving You,” “Take It On the Run,” and many, many more. More recently, REO has been featured in Season Three of the hit Netflix series, Ozark, with an episode entitled: “Kevin Cronin Was Here.” Cronin sang a duet with Dolly Parton on his number-one hit, “Keep on Loving You” for her star-studded Rockstar album, which featured a who’s who of rock luminaries including Sir Paul McCartney, Elton John, and Sting, to mention just a few. Cronin performed on the 2022 season finale of American Idol, is a regular guest with the Jim Irsay Collection band, and is currently putting the finishing touches on his memoir, “Roll With The Changes… my life within and without REO Speedwagon.” REO Speedwagon launched their first Las Vegas residency in November of 2023, the sold-out “An Evening of Hi Infidelity …and More!,” with return engagements set for May, and again in October of 2024. The band is active in numerous charitable endeavors including the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Music Drives Us, and Moffitt Cancer Center.</p><p style=font-weight:400;text-align:center><strong>Connect with REO Speedwagon:</strong></p><p style=font-weight:400;text-align:center><a href=#>Website</a> | <a href=#>Instagram</a> | <a href=#>Facebook</a> | <a href=#>X</a> | <a href=#>TikTok</a></p><p style=font-weight:400><strong><u>About Yacht Rock Revue</u></strong></p><p style=font-weight:400>Step aboard a musical voyage like no other with Yacht Rock Revue!
