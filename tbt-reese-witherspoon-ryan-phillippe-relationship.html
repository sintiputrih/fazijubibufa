Before they could make it official, Reese became pregnant with her and Ryan’s first child. In 1999, just three months after the premiere of their soon-to-be cult classic Cruel Intentions, Reese and Ryan tied the knot during a romantic ceremony in Charleston, South Carolina. Three months into their wedded bliss, the actors welcomed a daughter, Ava. Four years later they welcomed a son, Deacon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them:</strong> Has a more perfect-looking couple every existed? No wonder they had kids so young — can you imagine looking like this and not feeling the urge to procreate as soon as humanly possible? Had they stayed together and had 10-20 more children, Reese and Ryan may have created a race of straight-up models.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Steve.Granitz/INACTIVE/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong> Sebastian Valmont and Annette Hargrove will forever be our everything.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Archive Photos/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup:</strong> Reese and Ryan both agree that they were just too young when they started dating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2015, Ryan told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Larry King</a> he thought age was to blame for his 2007 divorce. "I think more of the problem was age. When we got together we were so young," he explained. “I think it can create issues with two people in this industry because there's so much noise that goes along with it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reese echoed his sentiment during an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>ITV’s Lorraine</a> in 2017. “I got married when I was 23 and I had two kids by the time I was 27. So I don’t know, you know, sometimes it’s good to know yourself,” Witherspoon shared. "I would never change anything," she continued, explaining, “I've said to my daughter, I think, you know, [at] 25, you start to know yourself a little bit better."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from their respective ages, Phillippe has long been rumored to have begun an affair with Stop-Loss co-star Abbie Cornish while on set (and still married to Witherspoon) in 2006.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gregg DeGuire/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Phillippe and Cornish dated until early 2010. After their split, Ryan had a summer fling with then 21-year-old actress and model Alexis Knapp, who gave birth to her first (and Ryan’s third) child, a daughter named Kai, in the summer of 2011. Phillippe spent the next 5 years with girlfriend (and eventual fiancée) Paulina Slagter before breaking off the engagement in late 2016.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Professionally, Phillippe’s seen success with USA drama Shooter, which aired its final episode earlier this month.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2011, Reese wed her talent agent boyfriend Jim Toth. The following year they welcomed a son, Tennessee, who celebrates his sixth birthday later this month.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2012, Reese founded production company Pacific Standard, which is now a subsidiary of her 2016 media company Hello Sunshine. The actress has since produced and/or starred in several films (Wild, Gone Girl, Hot Pursuit) and HBO hit series Big Little Lies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The year after launching her production company, Reese embarked on a clothing and lifestyle brand called Draper James.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Oh, and then she wrote a book:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What can’t this woman do?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGekl8FuvsSeqp5lp57BqbHRrKeop55iv7qtzWanoaGcobaxvMRmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./latest-sci-fi-news-james-gunn-admits-hes-dcs-real-life-batman-as-robert-pattinson-going-shirtless-incites-early-oscar-talk.html><span>←</span><span>Latest Sci-Fi News: James Gunn admits hes DCs real-life Batman as Robert Pattinson going shirt</span></a>
