After a long day in workshops for their respective musical projects, the two of them slip into the familiar language of longtime collaborators, with inside jokes and catch-ups. You may have seen it onstage before, in a musical called Wicked.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34ksdq000f3b7hy2awo3z1@published data-word-count=180>When that show opened on Broadway on October 30, 2003, Chenoweth originated the role of Galinda/Glinda, the perky good witch with hidden insecurities, and Menzel played Elphaba, the outcast turned green wicked witch. The show, based on Gregory Maguire’s prequel to The Wizard of Oz, with a book by Winnie Holzman, songs by Stephen Schwartz, and directed by Joe Mantello, was an expensive, effects-heavy production, coming to New York after a very long development. The reviews were middling to negative. But there was something in its spectacle, its music, and especially that friendship between Glinda and Elphaba, and hordes of fans, especially young women, began making their way to the Gershwin Theatre, and still do. A whole generation of actresses have succeeded them in those parts onstage and will soon do so onscreen with the long-in-the-works film adaptation — and in other musicals clearly inspired by Wicked, most notably Frozen. “I’m always so proud of what Idina and I laid down,” Chenoweth says. “So many women have done so well in those roles. That means that we did our jobs.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kser000g3b7hfsn4vfyl@published data-word-count=27><strong>Kristin, you started on workshops for Wicked in 2000 and then Idina auditioned and joined the show in 2001.

She was there in her costume with the bucket. I told her how amazing I thought she was. We had common friends and stuff, but I didn’t want to bother her because I knew she was exhausted.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34ksh3000i3b7h4gibjhby@published data-word-count=12>Kristin Chenoweth: I didn’t even know that.

I had a couple of friends in Rent, and I had gone on the sly. I know La Bohème well, but I was like, What’s this Rent going to be? and I was blown away by her. So I saw her backstage at the Tonys. You’ll never remember this, but I was walking down the stairs and she was walking up, and as we passed, I was like, “Hi, you’re great.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kskd000l3b7hpiyg150e@published data-word-count=6>I.M.: Well, at least, thank you.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kslk000m3b7hhogy6sua@published data-word-count=43><strong>When you started working together on Wicked together in those workshops, how far away did it feel from what you could go see onstage today?</strong><br>K.C.: I mean, it changed a lot. I thought it got better and better, frankly, and it needed to.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34ksmd000n3b7h2b743hie@published data-word-count=70>I.M.: We’re both working on original musicals now, and it’s scary. You’re putting in a lot of time and a lot of love. I think, as with Wicked, if the show has three magical moments that can get everybody all the time, it’s worth holding onto and figuring it out. Six months later it changes and it sucks and then you come back a year later and fix it again.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34ksna000o3b7hoaz14cmd@published data-word-count=25>K.C.: Once we got to our San Francisco tryout, the critics weren’t loving it, but the audiences were. I remember thinking that between “Defying Gravity”—</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kspz000p3b7hvl1fktye@published data-word-count=2>I.M.: “Popular”—</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34ksqw000q3b7hdofku4de@published data-word-count=65>K.C.: —And “For Good,” there’s your three things. You’re absolutely right. People always said that there wasn’t a show in two women together as leads. When it was pitched to me it was like, “You’re very much the side character. You’re very much the supporting character.” When Idina got cast, it felt like it wasn’t going to be that. It felt like we were together.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34ksrz000r3b7hymyb09ak@published data-word-count=114><strong>Let’s talk about those three moments. Do you remember first singing “For Good” together?</strong><strong><br></strong>I.M.: I’ve seen the footage of us in the rehearsal room [from a <a href=#>PBS documentary</a> about the making of the show], and that was pretty early into us learning it. The great thing was being in a room with an amazing composer and accompanist, standing at the piano with your fellow actor friend, knowing you’re creating something. It was working with people that embrace or encourage us to give our feedback and let ourselves be part of these characters and don’t just plant these melodies on us. They want it to be right for us and our voices and our emotionality.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kst0000s3b7hj8uu2qv6@published data-word-count=65>K.C.: Stephen Schwartz was very wise in letting Elphaba take the higher part in that number because she’s flying. She’s on her way, and Glinda’s become more grounded. I remember thinking, This is why people do music theater right here. And then I thought, If they cut this, then I don’t know what the show’s about anymore. But luckily, we were on the same page.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34ksve000t3b7hxql1yyct@published data-word-count=58><strong>I wanted to ask about something specific in “Defying Gravity” — on top of all the stage magic required to pull off the flying, Elphaba ends the song with this distinctive aaAAaaAHH button riff people have nicknamed the </strong><a href=#><strong>“battle cry.”</strong></a> <strong>You can hear it at the end of every Wicked TV commercial.</strong><br>K.C.: And that was all her.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kswl000u3b7hojavkwip@published data-word-count=7>I.M.: The notes are written, I think.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34ksxm000v3b7h1xg8vxez@published data-word-count=11>K.C.: Not when you first got it, girl. I was there.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34ksyi000w3b7h0xraa3x2@published data-word-count=33>I.M.: I do know that “So if you care to find me” was originally much lower, and I was like, “Can I please take that out of the basement? She’s going up here.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kszl000x3b7hqddvkcye@published data-word-count=9>K.C.: Thank God she did.

I went to Stephen and said, “I feel she should be a soprano.” He goes, “You just want to sing your high notes.” I go, “Well, kind of, but I also want the character to come alive.” And that’s Glinda. If anybody’s a fucking soprano on the show, it’s her. But that’s a testament to Stephen. He listened to us both.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kt2z00103b7hiukvab4s@published data-word-count=116><strong>In “Popular,” there’s a little dance Glinda does, hopping across the stage going “La la …” The mannerism, to me, is very Kristin Chenoweth, and now every actress I’ve seen in the part since does some version of it. Did you find that in the room?</strong><strong><br></strong>K.C.: I grew up very terribly wanting to be a ballerina. It was never that I wanted to be a singer or anything. But then I had flat feet. I can’t turn, certainly can’t jump. When Glinda’s singing that, I just imagine her in her room growing up. She probably loved ballet. She was a girlie-girl. So I went with the idea that she probably practiced and she wasn’t any good.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kt4400113b7h1k0ulym2@published data-word-count=125>I.M.: We were going through so many changes at the time, and I’ve since learned that cold reading was something that gave me anxiety. I’ve worked with coaches on it, after the Wicked experience. But Kristin can pick up the paper and hear the rhythm immediately. It was something I always aspired to. My way of doing it’s different. I found my way now, in that I’m okay with making mistakes, but at least some real choices. I loved watching her process, especially with “Popular.” I always remember her blocking “Popular” for the first time in the rehearsal room. She figured out what she wanted to do, what props she wanted, where the lipstick should go. Her confidence, I think, really puts people at ease.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kt5500123b7htlrww7rk@published data-word-count=97>K.C.: It’s funny, I listen to you talk, and I never once thought you had that anxiety. I always thought she was concentrating and mapping out her role. I remember sitting when you were doing “The Wizard and I.” It was a whole new song [replacing <a href=#>“Making Good,”</a> which Stephanie J. Block, who played Elphaba in the early readings, had sung] and you were embodying the character. I also remember the first time she got her green on. It was like she was a butterfly — she became the part. I’m glad I got to witness that.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kt6900133b7hficzgdpg@published data-word-count=141><strong>Idina, how did you feel in the moment of first becoming green?</strong><strong><br></strong>I.M.: I think for a lot of women who are known to be larger than life, who fill a room, there’s this thing of wanting to be seen and loving the attention and appreciation for our gifts but also, when people are actually looking at you, feeling terrified and vulnerable. That’s Elphaba’s whole journey. For me, it was the same thing. Everyone was staring at me that day and they were giving me such love, telling me how beautiful I looked. And there were so many thoughts going through my head. I was excited to be doing this role and I was thinking Am I stealing focus here?” and “Is that okay?” All those things. As women, we want to own something, but fear that’s off-putting. Can we love ourselves?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kt7800143b7htpusoe97@published data-word-count=21>K.C.: Can we accept when people are saying, “We love you”? It’s hard to go, “I receive what you’re throwing down.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kt9z00153b7hlsxuxk8e@published data-word-count=31><strong>Idina flew at the end of “Defying Gravity” and Kristin entered the show flying in her bubble.

You stand on it and then you close this metal belt. Once it’s connected, it tells the computer you’re safe and you’re good. I remember they wanted to show me how safe it was, so one of the big crew guys rode in it. But the funny thing is when it doesn’t go up. When that happens, you unplug it and you walk and just sing “Defying Gravity” down center stage.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34ktj0001a3b7ht3sqjm1e@published data-word-count=60><strong>When was the first time it didn’t work and you had a no-fly show?</strong><strong><br></strong>I.M.: I have to say it didn’t go wrong for a really long time.

I ran off the stage to some crew guy and was like “Undo my dress now, now, now!” Idina’s going “Defying Gravity” and probably looking around for me.

What were those conversations like?</strong><br>I.M.: I think a lot of Elphaba’s stuff was super-expositional. A lot of people were doing stuff around her, and she was going, “Oh, a lion. Oh, the scarecrow,” just commenting. She didn’t have enough action. It sounds silly because she defies gravity. But within the scene, things were happening around her instead of her having an action. That’s the stuff that they worked on. They were also trying to give her a sense of humor that was completely different from Kristin’s to give her some self-deprecating humor. She was a little flat, and so they worked on that. I also got more confident too. So I think it’s a combination of everyone evolving.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34ku6y001p3b7htbmw9fh2@published data-word-count=42><strong>On October 30, 2003, how did the opening-night show on Broadway go?</strong><br>K.C.: I don’t remember.

I don’t know how you felt, Idina, but I just needed the opening night thing to happen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34ku86001q3b7hoi8d6ny2@published data-word-count=47>I.M.: I like an opening night a lot because the critics have gone already, so opening night is friends and family. I tend to have more fun. Unfortunately, I think I always give a better performance then than the night when the reviewers are there, but whatever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> Bows on opening night, October 30, 2003.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34ku9d001r3b7hldxzib18@published data-word-count=71><strong>Were you anxious about the reviews? The critics in the major outlets (in the Times, Ben Brantley complimented Menzel and especially Chenoweth but </strong><a href=#><strong>wrote that</strong></a><strong> “Wicked does not, alas, speak hopefully for the future of the Broadway musical”) were not fans of the show, though others were kinder. (Elysa Gardner in </strong><a href=#><strong>USA Today</strong></a><strong> said “this is the most complete, and completely satisfying, new musical I’ve come across in a long time.”)</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kuaq001s3b7h3cqi2iwa@published data-word-count=66>K.C.: I’m always anxious to see what they write, but it doesn’t define how I’m going to feel about the show, because I made a commitment to it. Who doesn’t want good reviews? We did. But at the same time, as I told her, you’re defying gravity at the end of act one, do you hear the audience? It ain’t gonna matter, baby. And it didn’t.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kubr001t3b7hsr75y8ga@published data-word-count=15>I.M.: We had the word-of-mouth and the kids, and that built through the whole year.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kucs001u3b7hlbsfmjmg@published data-word-count=84>K.C.: It was so sweet, and so precious. I remember the stage door was like a Madonna concert. One night there was this burly guy standing there waiting for me. He was like, “Miss Chenoweth, I’m not ashamed to admit it, I like the piece.” I said, “what do you do?” He goes, “I’m a truck driver.” So as much as it was sweet to see little girls and our tribe loving it, it was nice to see somebody you wouldn’t expect at all.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kudv001v3b7h6oozjfxp@published data-word-count=126>I.M.: It had a slow burn. We were getting lots of letters and feedback from people, whether they be young girls or non-gender-conforming kids that see themselves in the role, or moms and daughters going to see the show together, or a cancer survivor who says “For Good” gets them through their chemo. That doesn’t happen, like, boom. It’s incremental, every week somebody says something and you start to go, “Wow.” Then you start to feel a real responsibility, I think, to the bigger picture. For me, I became less self-absorbed. We’re putting something out, but we’re also being given a gift. I learned so much about myself and about other people. When you play an empathic character, it teaches you so much more about humanity.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kueu001w3b7h6v4c84r0@published data-word-count=174><strong>In the spring of 2004, Wicked was nominated for Best Musical at the Tonys, and you were both nominated for Best Actress. It was an intense April, where the sorts of tactics and spending that Oscar campaigns deployed came to Broadway. Avenue Q ran pretty much directly against Wicked (“Vote your heart” was </strong><a href=#><strong>the tagline of Avenue Q’s campaign</strong></a><strong>) and won Best Musical, but Idina won Best Actress. How did it feel to be in the middle of that?</strong><br>K.C.: I must’ve been a little slow on this. I remember thinking, I’m not going to show up at everything, and I didn’t. I didn’t campaign for Charlie Brown [for which Chenoweth won a Supporting Actress Tony], so I didn’t understand that this was a thing. I believed our work spoke for itself. I mean, I was very surprised. We were the big show, so I thought we’re probably going to win. I am a big fan of Avenue Q. They had their show and their journey. I love it. But our show is still running.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kug2001x3b7hyalmcr00@published data-word-count=85>I.M.: We had the big show with all the money and the budget, so they demonized it. But I want to say something that I’ll never forget that Kristin did that I thought was so generous and kind of spirit. It was maybe two days before Tony Night, and we were about to go out for our curtain call. She said, “You better be writing a speech because you’re going to win this.” I hadn’t been writing a speech. I thought that was so —</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kuhc001y3b7hjzz04wsq@published data-word-count=9>K.C.: I wanted her to know what I thought.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kuk1001z3b7h8znuop7u@published data-word-count=43>I.M.:&nbsp; We were both not in touch with the politics of everything. Donna Murphy had won the Drama Desk for Wonderful Town. In my head I was like, I’m not going to win this.

There was such emotion for me that she won. I was like, Fuck, yeah. I felt like we did it. Our show did it. We didn’t win the big prize, but we had that.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kumg00213b7h89mnqujm@published data-word-count=111><strong>Maybe they were encouraged by the fact that you were both nominated for awards in the same category, but there were persistent rumors that you were at each other’s necks backstage.</strong><br>K.C.: I’d like to speak on this. After a certain amount of time after we opened, my mom was dealing with cancer. I was emotional and I was thinking about some other things. To me, there was no way that I would win a Tony. Yes, it’s the two girls as leads. But it’s Elphaba’s story. I needed to deal with that part of me. I was very emotional. I tried to push it out, I mean, if only people knew.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kunm00223b7hcv8xfpij@published data-word-count=25>I.M.: Unfortunately people like to do that to women.

I’m sure, as a sister, I got on her nerves sometimes. I’m positive I did. I get on my own nerves most of the time. But you also know what the other one’s going through.

We would always look at each other and say, “I got you. You got me. We’re making this thing together. We love each other.” People were saying stuff out there, and we were good at trying to bring it back to the two of us, because that’s all that matters.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kv0z00293b7hbjifegay@published data-word-count=73>K.C.: When that was all starting to happen, some people enjoyed the rumors too. If I could go back in time, I’d be like, “I know what y’all are doing. Stop.” At one awards presentation, I said to Idina, “Can we go out and I’ll have on my neck brace and you have your head wrap and maybe a crutch?” I wanted it to look like we were beating up on each other.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kv1u002a3b7hflhb2ms8@published data-word-count=14>I.M.: Just take the piss out of it all.

I had given, even before Dee came on, lots of time to the show, and I didn’t want to stay too long at the fair. And yet it was bittersweet when I left. I couldn’t even say good-bye. I remember Marc Platt saying, “Do you want a party or something?” I said, “No. I don’t do good-byes.” I didn’t go into the Gershwin Theatre again until we did the 15-year reunion, because I think I would’ve cried.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kv5m002d3b7hqh6w0bdw@published data-word-count=44>I.M.: After I won the Tony, I realized that they weren’t going to fire me, so I was able to enjoy myself a little bit more. I think that I enjoyed staying longer because I could breathe. People liked me. I had more fun.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kv8q002e3b7hrxw9h6qi@published data-word-count=18><strong>When you’ve gone back to see Wicked, how does it feel to see other actors play these roles?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kv9n002f3b7hkqyvm7pc@published data-word-count=22>K.C.: I’ve only seen it once.

I didn’t want to tell people I was there until after I saw the show. I wouldn’t want anyone to feel self-conscious. How do I say this? I’m always so proud of what Idina and I laid down. So many women have done so well in those roles. That means that we did our jobs.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kve0002i3b7hdhpc4721@published data-word-count=88>I.M.: We have incredible pride — the good pride, about what we built together and what we were a part of.&nbsp; I brought my son and his basketball team recently to Wicked. The only other time I’d been was back when he was 4 and rambunctious, hitting the people sitting in front of us. I had to leave halfway through, and I wrote a long note to the Glinda and Elphaba to say I’d be back to see the second act — my son was just ruining it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kvfe002j3b7hvamv9mmh@published data-word-count=75>Years later, we go back and we’re in the taxi with his whole basketball team, and for whatever reason I had to say to them I was the original star in it. Then, when we’re sitting there watching it and I’d lean over to my son: “Oh, you see that little move? I came up with that. You see that? Kristin, who originated Glinda, she’s the one that came up with that ballet move there.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kvgx002k3b7hv8xfz20u@published data-word-count=6>K.C.: But what was their reaction?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clo34kvhw002l3b7hvbowlqcp@published data-word-count=31>I.M.: My son—he pretends to be cool about it, but when he’s in a moment like that, he gets really emotional.
