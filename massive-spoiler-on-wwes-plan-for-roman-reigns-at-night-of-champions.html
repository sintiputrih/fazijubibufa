Night of Champions will be a very interesting addition to their saga, to say the least. In fact, it might add even more drama to Roman Reigns’ faction.</p><p>One fan tweeted at Boozer666 to ask, “Boozer please tell me the plan isn’t for Sami and KO to drop the titles to Roman.” This was a legitimate question, because Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa are set to take on Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Boozer666, who is getting a lot of attention for his insider scoops, simply tweeted back, “Na” to this question. It appears that Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens will retain their Undisputed WWE Tag Team Titles at Night of Champions.</p><p>We’re not sure how Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn will retain their titles on May 27th. There are a few ways that they can go about that, including a DQ finish where the Bloodline just destroys the babyfaces with foreign objects.</p><p>Only time will tell how Night of Champions pans out, because you never know what can happen in WWE.
