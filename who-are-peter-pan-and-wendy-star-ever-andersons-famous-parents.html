One of many in a slew of Disney live-action remakes, Peter Pan and Wendy breaks the mold of its predecessor by reworking the source material rather than sprinkling a few splashes of change across a beloved story. Part of the joyous fan response to the film comes from the seemingly stellar young actors cast as the titular characters.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=492 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>While the actor portraying Peter Pan (Alexander Molony) is a newcomer to the movie world, his costar <strong>Ever Anderson</strong> comes from a prestigious line of actors and filmmakers. Despite their prominence in the field, Anderson’s parents tried to keep the young actor from venturing into the world of showbiz. The youngster could not be dissuaded, however, and with her roots running so deeply in the industry, it’s almost impossible to blame her for wanting to follow in her mother’s footsteps.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-ever-anderson-s-mom data-injectable=false>Who is Ever Anderson’s mom?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Milla-Jovovich.jpg><p data-characters=553 data-current-count=853 data-injectable=true>Ever Anderson’s mother is none other than Soviet-born actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Milla Jovovich</a>. The well-known actress has starred in a number of films over the years and is widely known for her campy, action-packed performances in The Fifth Element and the Resident Evil franchise. Jovovich has been open about her own mother’s push for her to become an actress, and though she did land plenty of roles before she hit her breakout performance, her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">diminished contribution</a> to the film Dazed and Confused nearly dissuaded the starlet from pursuing a career in Hollywood.</p><p data-characters=923 data-current-count=923 data-injectable=true>Luckily for audiences everywhere, Jovovich returned to L.A. where she was cast in her breakout role in the career-defining The Fifth Element as the confused alien Leeloo de Sabat. Her career took off, and while she went on to star in The Story of Joan of Arc and was cast in large-scale productions like He Got Game and The Messenger, Jovovich diversified her portfolio through modeling and singing. The actress has been included on several soundtracks over the years, and frequently contributes tracks for projects she takes on. Her largest claim to fame has been the Resident Evil series, in which she plays Alice, the main character across 6 films. The gun-wielding, butt-kicking character continued to be a fan favorite long after the series devolved into a campy mess, with Jovovich remaining a highlight for fans of the series. It was on the set of the first film that Jovovich met her now-husband Paul W.S. Anderson.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who is Ever Anderson’s dad?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Paul-WS-Anderson.jpg><p data-characters=708 data-current-count=1008 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul W.S. Anderson</a> is a British filmmaker known for his over-the-top science fiction productions. The director’s first film was Shopping, the same movie that launched Jude Law to stardom. Anderson is known for his video game adaptations, starting with Mortal Kombat (1995). Like his wife, Anderson became much more widely known after he wrote and directed Resident Evil. He met Milla Jovovich on the set for the film and the two were engaged within a year. While the couple stayed in a will-they-won’t-they situation for several years, the birth of their eldest daughter, Ever Anderson, brought the two together for good. The couple has two other daughters, with the youngest being welcomed back in 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMmqmeZaCawaa%2BjKmYp2WRo7Fuw8Snm7Jlo6mus3nEr5yrZZGjsaa%2B0qilrGWWlrqwwdJmp5qqlaPBtHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-hanks-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Hanks Net Worth How Much is Hanks Worth?</span></a>
