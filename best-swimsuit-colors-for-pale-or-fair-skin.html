We’re beyond excited for the start of summer, but after a long winter spent mostly indoors, our pale skin may not exactly be swimwear-ready. Our tans from last year have long faded, and we certainly won’t achieve a sun-kissed glow right at the start of the season. You could try using a self-tanner at home to get your glow on, or you can shop for swimsuits in colors that complement fair or pale skin!"><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Our tans from last year have long faded, and we certainly won’t achieve a sun-kissed glow right at the start of the season. You could try using <a href=# rel=noopener>a self-tanner</a> at home to get your glow on, or you can shop for swimsuits in colors that complement fair or pale skin!</p><h3>Which Swimsuit Colors Should I Look for if I Have Pale Skin?</h3><p>This is the tricky part — finding the right color that will look great on pale skin is totally subjective for a number of reasons. For one, not all fair skin is the same. We all have different skin undertones that can dictate which hues would work best. The three general categories that you may fall under are cool, warm and neutral. Unsure of where you stand? We can help!</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Healthline</a>, you can use your veins to try and figure out what your skin’s undertones are. Take a closer look at your arms! If you have blue or purple-looking veins, chances are you have cooler undertones. Try seeking out jewel tones, blues and greens if that’s where you fall. If they look green, then you may be in the warm category — which is ideal for terracotta shades, olive green and bright red.&nbsp; But if you think that they’re essentially colorless or simply match the color of your skin, your undertones are likely neutral — in which case muted tones work best. You may also have a mix of undertones, so you have more complementary colors to choose from!</p><p>Now that you have a better idea of what colors to keep an eye out for, it’s time to shop for a new suit! We’re keeping this new swimsuit journey going by offering up amazing styles that come in the perfect colors to flatter pale or fair skin. Check out the full roundup below!</p><h2>12 Ideal Swimsuit Styles for Pale or Fair Skin</h2><h3>CUPSHE Women’s One Piece Swimsuit</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CUPSHE-Womens-One-Piece-Swimsuit.png><p>This swimsuit is one of Amazon’s all-time top sellers, so we had to include it in this roundup!
