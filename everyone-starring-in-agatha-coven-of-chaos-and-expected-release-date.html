The show has reportedly wrapped production and is gearing up to release soon. Although much is being kept under wraps, most of the star-studded cast, as well as each of their characters, have been revealed.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>The series, which will follow Kathryn Hahn’s character from WandaVision, Agatha Harkness, has changed titles a total of three times before landing on its present formation. It had previously gone by Agatha: House of Harkness and Agatha: Coven of Chaos.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>The show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">finished filming</a> in Atlanta on May 28. WandaVision creator Jac Schaeffer returned to produce, direct, and write. Kathryn Hahn will lead the story as Agatha and has described the spin-off as being <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“very delicious.”</a></p><h2 data-injectable=false>Kathryn Hahn as Agatha Harkness</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/WandaVision-Agatha-Kathryn-Hahn.jpg><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>Fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe met Agatha as housewife Agnes, but by the end of the Elizabeth Olsen vehicle, it’s revealed she infiltrated Westview, the town Wanda Maximoff was manipulating, and is actually an all-powerful witch. She’s been alive for hundreds of years and belonged to the Salem Coven before decimating it in 1693, during the Salem witch trials.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>Unlike its other inhabitants, Agatha was free from Wanda’s spell the whole time, and had been messing with her plans and studying her magic, eager to discover its source and steal it. Agatha recognized Wanda’s insane powers as Chaos Magic, which can manipulate, warp, and reconstruct the fabric of existence and reality, and can only be used by one mythical entity: the Scarlet Witch.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>By the end of WandaVision, after an intense fight between Agatha and Wanda, Wanda absorbs all of Agatha’s magic, effectively becoming the Scarlet Witch, and traps her in Westview to live out her days as Agnes.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>Agatha’s popularity led Marvel Studios to give her her own separate series, but it’s unclear whether it will continue from the events of WandaVision, or take us back to her origin story as a part of the Salem Coven. It will most likely be both, as fans saw Wanda seemingly perish in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, possibly freeing Agatha from the spell the Scarlet Witch had put her under.</p><h2 id=h-emma-caulfield-ford-as-sarah-proctor-dottie-jones-debra-jo-rupp-as-sharon-davis-mrs-hart-and-more-wandavision-returnees data-injectable=false>Emma Caulfield Ford as Sarah Proctor/Dottie Jones, Debra Jo Rupp as Sharon Davis/Mrs. Hart, and more WandaVision returnees</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Emma-Caulfield-Ford-and-Debra-Jo-Rupp-in-WandaVision.jpg><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>Fellow WandaVision star Emma Caulfield confirmed her presence in Darkhold Diaries <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a while back</a>. She will be reprising her role as Westview resident, Dottie Jones, whose real identity outside Wanda’s spell is Sarah Proctor. Also returning from the Westview populace is Mrs. Hart aka Sharon Davis, the sweet wife of Vision’s boss Arthur Hart.</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joining the two ladies</a> are Kate Forbes as Agatha’s mother Evanora Harkness, David Lengel as Sarah/Dottie’s husband Harold Proctor/Phil Jones, Amos Glick as the mailman Dennis, David Payton as Wanda and Vision’s neighbor John Collins/Herb, and Brian Brightman as Sheriff Miller. Their participation in the show likely points toward a portion of the story occurring in the present time, following the events of WandaVision.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Joe Locke</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Joe-Locke.jpg><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=808 data-injectable=true>Heartstopper‘s rising star Joe Locke was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced as part of Agatha: Darkhold Diaries in November 2022</a>. His role was not disclosed, but in true Marvel fashion, fans have been running wild with theories, the most popular of which is that he’ll be playing a grown-up version of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billy Maximoff, aka Wiccan, one of Wanda’s super-powered twins</a>. Julian Hilliard, the actor who plays young Billy in both WandaVision and Doctor Strange 2, also pretty much <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> this theory in a cheeky tweet.</p><p data-characters=513 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>Despite no direct correlation, this casting does make sense, seeing as Locke rose to fame playing gay teenager Charlie Spring on Netflix’s Heartstopper, and Wiccan is one of Marvel Comics’ most prolific gay characters. Co-star Patti LuPone <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">described</a> the young actor’s character, however, as a “familiar” — which in Western mythology is usually a small animal that serves as a servant to a witch. Locke <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has said</a> his time on set was “very full on, very physical, very emotional.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Aubrey Plaza</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Aubrey-Plaza.jpg><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true>The most talked about casting in Darkhold Diaries has been Parks and Rec alumni Aubrey Plaza. Her role is also undisclosed as of yet, so <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We Got This Covered took the time to explore some of the best options for the actress’s introduction in the MCU</a>. Fans, of course, are mostly hoping she will play a sexy evil witch, which Plaza would knock out of the park.</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rumors and unconfirmed scoops</a> indicate the acclaimed White Lotus thespian will be playing an original character who is the show’s main villain and a former lover of Agatha’s. Working with Hahn was one of the main motivators to get Plaza to join the MCU — the two had shared the screen before, on Parks and Rec, and remained friends since. For Plaza, Darkhold Diaries is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“the most elevated Marvel material that’s out there.”</a></p><h2 id=h-patti-lupone data-injectable=false>Patti LuPone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Patty-LuPone.jpg><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true>Broadway legend Patti LuPone’s inclusion in the Agatha: Darkhold Diaries cast widely increases its chances of becoming one of the most iconic in the MCU. The performer, not used to the top-level secrecy of the Marvel world, has given fans the clearest image of the show yet.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>LuPone <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spilled the beans on her character</a>, Lilia Calderu, as a “450-year-old Sicilian witch whose power is divination and whose trial is tarot.” Calderu is a part of Marvel Comics, making her debut in 1973 as a powerful sorceress and keeper of the Book of Cagliostro.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ali Ahn, Maria Dizzia, and Sasheer Zamata</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Ali-Ahn-Maria-Dizzia-Sasheer-Zamata-1.jpg><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=122 data-injectable=false>Billions‘ Ali Ahn and Orange is the New Black‘s Maria Dizzia are both <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> joining the show as witches.</p><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true>Sasheer Zamata will play Jennifer Kale, who is also a witch in the comics, despite the comedian confirming the ties to the source material will be minimal. “The way we formed this character is very different from what I think people expect,” Zamata told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mashable</a>. This particular casting leads us to believe that Darkhold Diaries will be leaning into a comedic tone — a genre in which Kathryn Hahn, Plaza, and LuPone all excel. Zamata’s experience on Saturday Night Live will be a fitting addition. She’s called the opportunity <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“a dream.”</a></p><h2 data-injectable=false>Miles Gutierrez-Riley and Okwui Okpokwasili</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Miles-Gutierrez-Riley-and-Okwui-Okpokwasili.jpg><p data-characters=532 data-current-count=832 data-injectable=true>Rounding out the Darkhold Diaries cast are The Wilds‘ Miles Gutierrez-Riley and dancer/performer Okwui Okpokwasili, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> informs. While there’s no information yet about who either actor could be playing, Gutierrez-Riley’s participation has attracted the most gossip. Some reports say he’s playing Teddy Altman, AKA Hulkling, Billy’s boyfriend and a member of the Young Avengers, others say he’ll be bringing a whole new original character to the MCU. Nothing has been confirmed.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Eric André (rumored)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Eric-Andre.jpg><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>Another spectacular addition to Darkhold Diaries‘ cast would be comedian Eric André, who has been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to be joining the cast</a>. André hosted his own, highly popular talk show for ten years, and is one of Hollywood’s most coveted comics.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>If his casting were to be confirmed, it would make Darkhold Diaries positively refreshing, and a new look for Marvel. This cast would deliver the most brilliant sitcom type of story, which gets even better when you consider the fact that most of them are witches.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>Considering her fan-favorite status, everyone is still hoping Elizabeth Olsen will at least make a cameo in Darkhold Diaries. The Scarlet Witch actress has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">previously remarked</a> that she “would love to pop up” in the series and never leave Kathryn Hahn’s side again.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Agatha: Darkhold Diaries anticipated release date</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/agatha-wandavision-3.jpg><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=734 data-injectable=true>Although it was initially set to hit all of our screens in the fall of 2023, Agatha: Darkhold Diaries was pushed back to late 2024 amid a mass calendar shuffle at Disney that included shows like What If… season 2 and Echo. As a result of both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, as well as the studio’s promise to space out its TV offerings, Darkhold Diaries will now debut a full three years after it was initially announced.</p><p data-characters=580 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true>According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. Copyright Office</a> (as discovered by fan account <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scarlet Witch Updates</a>) Darkhold Diaires has been given a projected release date of Sept. 19, 2024. Marvel has not confirmed this yet, and it’s possible reshoots and necessary edits could cause the date to fluctuate. However, like Loki season 2, Darkhold Diaries‘ updated release date falls on a Thursday instead of a Friday or even a Wednesday, as has been the case with previous Marvel Disney Plus shows. For that reason, Sept. 19 feels as close to a final release date as we’ve ever gotten.</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>This will allow Marvel to carry on its budding annual tradition of airing spooky-ish shows in time for Halloween. To compensate for the prolonged wait, Agatha: Darkhold Diaries will be 9 episodes long — 3 more than the usual Marvel Disney Plus format.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ymwsSrsKimlWLAta3Rq6Cnn12eu26txpqroZldmLy3sc1mpp9lk52usL%2BMmqWdZZWtvaav056bZqqVobKiv8Rmm5qslWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tony-khan-biography-wiki-age-family-girlfriend-business-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Tony Khan Biography, Wiki, Age, Family, Girlfriend, Business and Net Worth.</span></a>
