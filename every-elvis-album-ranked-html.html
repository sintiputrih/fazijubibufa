For everyone else, things get dicier. Despite his undeniable talents, Elvis was a wildly uneven recording artist. The string of soundtracks he released in the ’60s (largely at the behest of his exploitative manager Colonel Tom Parker) give the term&nbsp;<i>formulaic</i>&nbsp;as bulletproof a definition as anything in algebra, and consist of his shoddiest material. Yet even under those constraints, he could inhabit just about anything asked of him within the affable-sexy spectrum, leading to a range of results sentimentally perfect (“Can’t Help Falling in Love”) or perfectly ridiculous (“Song of a Shrimp,” his fond send-off to a family of crustaceans). In any case, he had the privilege and the burden of a voice that sounded legit trying out everything from a quavery tenor to a hubristic baritone, unafraid of operatic grandeur or gruffness or languor, with vibrato and falsetto and commitment, traces of which are present even when one can hear the poor guy itching to get out of the studio and back to his Graceland. The received wisdom regarding his albums — which prizes the&nbsp;<i>Sun Sessions</i>&nbsp;(which, had this ranking included compilation albums featuring no new or previously unreleased material, would’ve been a strong contender for the top-spot), Elvis’s first records for RCA, and his ’68 “comeback” recordings — overlooks some worthy stuff within the often indistinguishable heap making up the rest of his corpus. Even Presley’s worst soundtrack filler may get you there.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69f38ba7844704460001e583a5d561f7-2-0-2@published data-word-count=26>So, with a hip-swivel and a lip-curl, here’s our ranking of every LP containing new or previously unreleased tracks put out by RCA during Elvis’s lifetime.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/878/24f/aec3be2210e88d9e24e889a8e139933b7c-88875114562-MJ-025.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69f38ba7844704460001e583a5d561f7-4-0-0@published data-word-count=90><b>57. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=iZvv4A>Frankie and Johnny</a></i> (1966)<br></b>Elvis was so fed up with the soundtrack recording process at this point in his career that he threw a tantrum in the studio and had to record his vocals separately from the musicians. This album was the painful result, a mix of new ones like the ultra-sexist “What Every Woman Lives For” and “Petunia, the Gardener’s Daughter,” and traditional songs with an ersatz Dixieland flavor for this movie’s story of a 19th-century riverboat gambler. There’s also blues, gospel, and gypsy music at their cheesiest.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1c4/f12/67bc530aabf6bb5145b714b03df63e17f9-88875114562-MJ-029.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69f38ba7844704460001e583a5d561f7-6-0-0@published data-word-count=120><b>56. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=iZvv4A>Double Trouble</a></i> (1967)<br></b>Advertised as an “adventure filled with dames, diamonds, discotheques, and danger,” this movie featured a soundtrack for which the recording sessions once again got Elvis so mad that he stormed out of the studio.&nbsp; It could have been because he was expected to sing about “Old MacDonald” having a farm and going “E-I-E-I-O,” with the addition of embarrassing new lyrics about chicken fricassee, pork and beans, and burgers. Or it could have been because he had to perform the rest of this familiar mishmash of pseudo-smooth (“City by Night”), pseudo-rocking (“Long Legged Girl”), and pseudo-polka (“I Love Only One Girl”) and release it on the same day as his supreme acolytes the Beatles released <i>Sgt.

The title track tries to explain how to get your best girl excited on the drag strip and, despite the occasional genuine revving sound, never fully turns over. “There Ain’t Nothing Like a Song” tries to get you stoked about songcraft by getting you to chew on a tired rock groove with awkward interjections by the film’s co-star Nancy Sinatra.&nbsp; “Let Yourself Go” has an unconvincing psychedelic flavor, but might be the most fun thing here, along with Nancy Sinatra’s take on Lee Hazlewood’s cynical “Your Groovy Self.” The existentialism-light of “Who Are You (Who Am I?)” and the communist-baiting patriotism of “He’s Your Uncle, Not Your Dad” fare much worse.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/881/c02/28f794e0b26ef6b48b3f8fcde0eaccca71-88875114562-MJ-017.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69f38ba7844704460001e583a5d561f7-10-0-0@published data-word-count=91><b><i>54. </i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=iZvv4A><i>It Happened at the World</i><i>’s Fair</i></a> (1963)<br></b>The soundtrack to Elvis’s expensive Space Needle romp begins with a bland song about going into the unknown (“Beyond the Bend”) followed by a remake of “Fever” called “Relax,” which advises listeners to “defrost,” and is set to slimy finger-snapping. “Cotton Candy Land” repositions Mr. Sandman’s dream as a terrifying sugar high, and the saccharine “How Would You Like to Be?” is sung to a kid in the film to placate her, but frazzles every other listener; “Happy Ending” is another unhappy event.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/239/74f/db885d3a9f43fd69a7e28b6c97e7a83842-88875114562-MJ-040.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69f38ba7844704460001e583a5d561f7-12-0-0@published data-word-count=120><b>53. <a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=iZvv4A><i>That</i><i>’</i><i>s the Way It Is</i></a><i> </i>(1970)<br></b>Elvis was cranking out records in 1970, and this one was a cocktail of Jumpsuit Elvis from his longstanding tenure at the International Hotel in Vegas and some Nashville studio stuff loosely tied to a documentary film. The concert material is mainly of the showy countrypolitan variety, smooth but less exciting than his earlier live albums.&nbsp; However, we get Elvis tearing eagerly into “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling” and “Bridge Over Troubled Water.” The studio tracks tend to be sluggish and overwrought, with lyrics about tasting the “icing on the cake we’ve been baking with the past,” on “The Next Step Is Love.” &nbsp;As tragic songs about cake go, it’s no “MacArthur Park.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/415/de0/c3b0c616e412708488185a59b65004ab75-88875114562-MJ-039.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69f38ba7844704460001e583a5d561f7-14-0-0@published data-word-count=96><b>52<i>. <a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=iZvv4A>Almost in Love</a></i> (1970)<br></b>This budget-price collection of 45s and EP-only tracks, culled mainly from soundtracks, redundantly includes “Stay Away, Joe,” which was already included on other compilations.&nbsp; Elvis does his best Sinatra imitation on the crooning title track, “U.S. Male” is a driving version of a choice pun about an extremely threatening M-A-L-E persona, “Long Legged Girl (With the Short Dress On)” is as irritating as it was on the <i>Double Trouble</i> soundtrack, and the silly funk of “A Little Less Conversation” and “Rubberneckin’” ultimately worked better as techno-remixes in soccer and Toyota ads.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/63e/427/233ac9259cdc43ed80f20860bf0f161d34-88875114562-MJ-026.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69f38ba7844704460001e583a5d561f7-16-0-0@published data-word-count=94><b>51. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=iZvv4A>Paradise, Hawaiian Style</a></i> (1966)<br></b>Elvis plays a rugged chopper pilot in this, his third Hawaiian movie, and again he cranked out a soundtrack with his regular studio gang and stable of songwriters. He knew it was a stinker from the get-go.&nbsp; On “Scratch My Back,” Elvis coaxes his lover to “get rid of our itch together,” and “Queenie Wahine’s Papaya” turns the soothing fruit into an aggravating tongue-twister.&nbsp; This may do if you want more of what <i>Blue Hawaii</i> had — pedal steel, tropical content — but with a quarter of the charm.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0ba/fcf/372945c8fdde02cf6c899fa8e220139d8e-88875114562-MJ-021.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69f38ba7844704460001e583a5d561f7-18-0-0@published data-word-count=121><b>50. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=iZvv4A>Roustabout</a></i> (1964)<br></b>Elvis’s slickster manager, a former carny who dubbed himself Colonel Tom Parker (formerly Dutch immigrant Andrea van Kuijk), got a picture made for his star which took place in Parker’s old milieu, with Elvis playing the title fairground worker — who could sing mellifluously while performing motorcycle stunts. They got this hit soundtrack out of the odd concept, and a bit of insulting fun out of the repurposed Coasters’ tune “Little Egypt” about a guy having his mind blown by an exotic dancer, which is the highlight. <i>Panty raid</i> rhymes with <i>lemonade</i> in “Poison Ivy League,” one of several unconvincing songs here, sung from the perspective of a striving underdog — which Elvis had stopped being years prior.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/9d1/7df/dfcbcc39ddc7d0f2376dbe85bec7f5f0d1-88875114562-MJ-022.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69f38ba7844704460001e583a5d561f7-20-0-0@published data-word-count=115><b>49. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=iZvv4A>Girl Happy</a>&nbsp;</i>(1965)<br></b>Elvis was so embarrassed by most of this soundtrack to his spring-break fantasy flick that he asked for his vocals to be lower in the mix on the exuberant title track. He’s an impatient lover for the umpteenth time on “Do Not Disturb,” and chastises “The Meanest Girl in Town” on the closest this album gets to rock and roll. The sole non-soundtrack inclusion here, a song Elvis wrote with a pair of buddies called “You’ll Be Gone,” has melodramatic Spanish flavor leading to an operatic crescendo — a trick Elvis had mastered and deployed repeatedly by the mid-’60s. This is also the home of Diddley-beat-plus-bongos kitsch master class “Do the Clam.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/4fc/23a/39a91760735cf853568254ee70eae98360-88875114562-MJ-016.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69f38ba7844704460001e583a5d561f7-22-0-0@published data-word-count=64><b>48. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=iZvv4A>Girls!

Elvis got to distance himself from the worn-out commercial decisions imposed by Colonel Parker and dig deep into meaningful material of his own choosing, capturing some of the earlier TV special’s spontaneous sense of fun and inventiveness with spirited and unpredictable arrangements and performances, including a great rhythm section and backup singing that blows his mainstays, the often-stiff Jordanaires, out of the water. Although the songs are mainly two or three minutes long, they feel like they’re taking their time without ever lagging, and the straight country material like “I’m Movin’ On” benefits from elaborately funky interjections. A sense of purpose permeates the whole album, and not just the one explicit protest song, “In the Ghetto.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/436/a27/247b0bf862d3b5481450857b6bd8bd176e-88875114562-MJ-007.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69f38ba7844704460001e583a5d561f7-108-0-0@published data-word-count=87><b>5. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=iZvv4A>For LP Fans Only</a></i> (1959)<br></b>A thoroughly enjoyable mixture of early RCA singles plus a couple of his first <i>Sun</i> singles newly issued on LP, this was designed to keep Elvis fans satiated with “new” product during his Army stint, and Elvis had terrific stuff in his back pocket. This was the first way many people heard some of his best <i>Sun</i> tracks like “That’s All Right” and “Mystery Train,” and there’s primo r&b like “Lawdy Miss Clawdy” to show how convincingly versatile young Elvis was.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e09/7e0/ca8809fbbff1b151a210f2ae063ab65967-88875114562-MJ-008.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69f38ba7844704460001e583a5d561f7-110-0-0@published data-word-count=150><b>4. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=iZvv4A>A Date With Elvis</a></i> (1959)<br></b>Issued a few months after <i>For LP Fans Only</i>, this album was made with the same intention as its predecessor: to keep fans sated with Elvis material while he was off driving tanks in the Army. This time around, he plays explicitly with his suave military image with the hi-hello-I’m-a-soldier-Elvis-doll cover shot and gatefold image of a calendar marked with the precise date of his U.S. return. Musically, it’s a terrific mix of newer recordings like the chastising but flippant “(You’re So Square) Baby I Don’t Care” and <i>Sun</i> tracks like “Blue Moon of Kentucky” (his <i>other</i> classic lamentation over a blue moon), and it showcases his enthusiastic inner-boy on “Good Rockin’ Tonight” and the delightfully cheery (but also menacing) entreaty “Baby Let’s Play House.” “I Forgot to Remember to Forget” is another reminder that Elvis could be just as effectively sexy when silly.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/01c/a3e/e80410c16594ae53ec07a3b771ee42d734-88875114562-MJ-034.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69f38ba7844704460001e583a5d561f7-112-0-0@published data-word-count=193><b>3. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=iZvv4A>Elvis (NBC-TV Special)</a></i> (1968)<br></b>These are the live performances from the TV “comeback” that got Elvis excited about performing again, with good reason after his long slew of soundtrack obligations. His work here is loose and gritty and inspired, with the opening medley of “Trouble” and “Guitar Man” leading to an extended hits medley, and his renewed sense of purpose is as irresistible now as it was to the fans present at the shows. On “Blue Christmas” we even get to hear what sounds like audience orgasms and insinuating band-issued instructions to “play it dirty.” The whole thing is casual and comfortably <i>un</i>comfortable, vulnerable and confident: “Lawdy Miss Clawdy” breaks down into some choice ad libs about the singer’s lip and gets back up as “Hound Dog” and “Heartbreak Hotel”; Elvis’s on-the-spot rewrites and chuckles during “Love Me Tender” endear. The closing song “If I Can Dream” has a searing gospel intensity that his first couple of proper gospel LPs never quite captured. This is a moving document (and deconstruction) of Elvis’s unique embodiment of r&b, gospel, country, and rock and roll. An essential gateway to his late period, indulgences and all.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/114/ee3/b072af0aa00727f1fe17d74ae0a0ca2255-88875114562-MJ-005.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69f38ba7844704460001e583a5d561f7-114-0-0@published data-word-count=146><b>2. <a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=iZvv4A><i>Elvis</i><i>’ </i><i>Golden Records</i></a> (1958)<br></b>Historically important and precedent-setting, but even more delectable sonically, it’s another first for Elvis, and our pleasure organs can be as eternally grateful to this album as they are to the first ice-cream parlor to offer multiple scoops. &nbsp;This was the first time rock-and-roll songs had been compiled into a hits-collection LP, in this case consisting of crisply remastered versions of the million-selling rockers and ballads released throughout ’56 and ’57 as singles, including the thrilling “Hound Dog,” the majestically lonesome “Heartbreak Hotel,” and the simply beautiful “Love Me Tender.” Despite being a Colonel Parker cash grab — a designation that could be given to so much of Elvis’s ensuing work — meant to tide over fans during the first stretch of Elvis’s two-year showbiz break, it’s a splendid summation of his pre-Army highlights, not arranged chronologically, but for listening pleasure.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/4d1/f67/b06aff8aea4efab6c67826d960fe54063f-88875114562-MJ-001.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69f38ba7844704460001e583a5d561f7-116-0-0@published data-word-count=226><b>1<i>. <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a></i> (1956)<br></b>This template for the hormonal enhancement of teens — Elvis’s first long-playing record — is also the first No.-1-charting rock-and-roll record, period, helping usher in the rock-LP era. Historical consequence aside, the music is a dynamite convergence of older <i>Sun</i> and newer RCA recordings, which served to feed the growing nationwide Elvis bedlam, and it’s equally perfect as a showcase for the thrusting dancer of “Blue Suede Shoes” as it is for the sensitive crooner experimenting in nocturnal melancholy at its hypnotic best on the ethereal “Blue Moon” and “I Love You Because.” At the same time, the desperate “I’ll Never Let You Go (Little Darlin’)” and “Money Honey” reveal an essential dangerous-rebel aspect to his appeal. (It’s no surprise that he worshipped James Dean, and you can somehow hear him channeling that adoration onto wax.) Elvis and his original band distill r&b, country, blues, and rockabilly into primal pop music. This is the material that the Beatles loved, and you can bet they listened especially closely to these songs and arrangements of tightly interwoven instrumentation topped with stirring guitar breaks and youthfully impassioned singing. Listen to that yearning, playful, courting voice cut through gorgeously on songs like “Tryin’ to Get to You” and you’ll understand what John Lennon meant when he said “Elvis was bigger than religion in my life .”</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Every Elvis Album, Ranked</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlob2dgaHymwsSrsGadnKu2tHnApZmupV2nrq%2B3xJ1loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./asian-stand-up-comedians.html><span>←</span><span>15 Best Asian Stand Up Comedians Who Are Known Worldwide!</span></a>
