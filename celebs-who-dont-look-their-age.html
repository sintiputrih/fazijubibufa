Whether it's procedures helping things along or just a natural beauty that continues to remain timeless, plenty of famous faces look younger than their years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some gorgeous celebs like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwen Stefani follow strict skincare routines</a> to ensure they stay looking fab. And not everyone turns to Botox for their smooth skin and youthful look. In fact, some celebrities rely on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unconventional beauty methods (that are apparently effective!)</a> to keep themselves looking amazing year after year.</p><p>Regardless of their methods, these celebs seem to defy age. In fact, fans may not be able to guess their age, even though these beautiful gals and handsome gents have been in the spotlight for decades already.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-didn-t-get-time-s-memo><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Jennifer Lopez Didn't Get Time's Memo</span></h2><p>In the summer of 2019, Jennifer Lopez celebrated her 50th birthday, and she still has fans shook. Of course, it shouldn't be that surprising since J. Lo has been rocking since the '90s. The mom of twins (and fiancee of Alex Rodriguez) hasn't let time slow her down or keep her from maintaining a super-fit bod.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lopez's evolution over the years</a>&nbsp;just proves our theory that she's a time-traveling goddess.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gabrielle-union-is-frozen-in-the-90s><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Gabrielle Union Is Frozen In The '90s</span></h2><p>Gabrielle Union and her hubby Dwyane Wade welcomed their first child together (via surrogate) in 2018, and the new mom was totally glowing. But you would never have guessed that this mom of one and stepmom to three is pushing 50. Yes, Gabrielle Union apparently stopped aging in the '90s, shortly before she was in&nbsp;Bring It On&nbsp;(which came out in 2000). In 2020, Gabrielle will turn an amazing 49 years old, and fans still don't believe it.</p><h2 id=will-smith-didn-t-age-after-the-90s-either><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Will Smith Didn't Age After The '90s, Either</span></h2><p>Will Smith is another '90s staple that has never faded from the spotlight. Whatever wrinkle cream he's been using is most effective, as Will is about to turn 52 in September 2020. The dad of three continues to star in films (like&nbsp;2019's&nbsp;Aladdin) and stick around Hollywood, even though his kids are threatening to show him up. Did you know his oldest son is already 27?!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=teri-hatcher-s-still-bikini-ready><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Teri Hatcher's Still Bikini Ready</span></h2><p>She swears by wine baths and plenty of exfoliation, and clearly, Teri Hatcher is on to something. She'll turn 56 years old in December of 2020, and it's honestly shocking. For fans of&nbsp;Desperate Housewives, the time warp is particularly trippy. Teri's embracing her years, as evidenced by her sharing of envy-inducing bikini pics. Maybe there was something in that&nbsp;Desperate Housewives water, since Marcia Cross is similarly youthful at 58! Or, it could be the apparently intense fitness routine Teri follows, explains&nbsp;The Blast.</p><h2 id=taraji-p-henson-just-gets-younger><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Taraji P. Henson Just Gets Younger</span></h2><p>Though Taraji P. Henson got her 'big break' in&nbsp;Baby Boy&nbsp;in 2001, she's been on the Hollywood radar most recently for starring in&nbsp;Hidden Figures (2016), voicing a character in&nbsp;Ralph Breaks the Internet, and even creating a makeup collab with MAC. But it might be her vegan diet that's really helped her stay young, as&nbsp;Live Kindly confirms the actress adopted veganism in 2017 to "avoid stomach cancer."&nbsp;So, how old is Taraji, really? She turns 50 in September of 2020!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-garner-can-t-possibly-be-over-35><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jennifer Garner Can't Possibly Be Over 35</span></h2><p>Maybe it's all the greens she eats? Jennifer Garner is arguably one of the most versatile actresses of our time, and it turns out she has some other special powers, too. Namely, the ability to look ageless! You probably wouldn't guess that Jennifer is anywhere over 40, max. But she turned 48 in 2020, and she definitely doesn't look like it. The mom of three (and Ben Affleck's ex) seems to be living her best life, and on the subject of beauty, she notes, "Beauty comes from a life well lived. If you've lived well, your smile lines are in the right places... what more do you need?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eva-longoria-was-of-advanced-maternal-age><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Eva Longoria Was 'Of Advanced Maternal Age'</span></h2><p>Eva Longoria is another&nbsp;Desperate Housewives alum who's not so desperate to get on in years. While Eva turned 45 in early 2020—and welcomed her son Santiago at the age of 43—you wouldn't know it by looking at her. And unlike other stars who were 'of advanced maternal age' (which, according to medical experts, is only 35), <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva carried her child without the help of a surrogate, and she says the timing was perfect</a>. Us Magazine quotes Eva as saying having her son later in life was "meant to be."&nbsp;Of course, her hubby doesn't look his age, either—José Bastón is already 52, and fans definitely couldn't have guessed that.</p><h2 id=pharrell-williams-might-as-well-be-a-vampire><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Pharrell Williams Might As Well Be A Vampire</span></h2><p>Did you know that Snoop Dogg and Pharrell Williams are only a year apart? While Snoop is older, he looks more his age (which is 48 as of 2020). Pharrell, however, still looks about 30, and fans can bet he'll continue to remain well-preserved for at least another decade. After all, it doesn't look like he's aged since the early 2000s, even though he turned 47 in 2020. Then again, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he and his wife welcomed their second, third, and fourth children in early 2017</a> (triplets!), confirmed&nbsp;Today,&nbsp;so maybe&nbsp;parenting toddlers will finally begin to age him—or at least cause a few grey hairs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cameron-diaz-s-looks-defy-all-logic><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Cameron Diaz's Looks Defy All Logic</span></h2><p>Before Cameron Diaz and her hubby Benji Madden welcomed their daughter Raddix in 2020, the tabloids loved speculating about whether or not Cam wanted kids. After all, even though she doesn't remotely look her age, Cameron turns 48 in 2020, so everyone assumed the clock was ticking. But Raddix's surprise arrival in 2020 via surrogate confirmed that Cameron and Benji were destined to become parents, just on their own timetable. Because like her lack of aging, Cameron seems to always do things her own way.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cameron Diaz And Benji Madden Have Been Married Since 2015: Here's What Else We Know</a></span></p><h2 id=salma-hayek-defies-her-years><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Salma Hayek Defies Her Years</span></h2><p>Fans may not have heard from Salma Hayek much in recent years, but that doesn't mean the actress has resigned herself to ungraceful aging. Nope, Salma is going to turn 54 in September 2020, and she's even more gorgeous than ever. The mom of one (her daughter Valentina is 12) has seemingly withdrawn from the limelight to raise her daughter alongside hubby François-Henri Pinault. Of course, it's possible that being married to a literal billionaire (François-Henri also has three other children) has afforded Salma some beauty treatments that fans could only dream of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Salma Hayek Is Rich, But Her Husband Is Filthy Stinkin Rich</a></span></p><h2 id=gwen-stefani-is-forever-young-in-fans-eyes><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Gwen Stefani Is Forever Young In Fans' Eyes</span></h2><p>Most fans remember Gwen Stefani's early days as a funky pop icon. Nowadays, she's toned things down a bit, especially when it comes to her style. Still, the natural beauty hasn't lost any of her good looks since her "Hollaback Girl" days. Gwen will turn 51 in October 2020, but fans would never know it. Of course, she credits beau Blake Shelton's love with keeping her young, but we're pretty sure it has more to do with her inner beauty (and some smart lifestyle habits).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwen Stefani Didn't Get Plastic Surgery, Here's How She Looks So Young</a></span></p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-s-fans-swear-she-s-ageless><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jennifer Aniston's Fans Swear She's Ageless</span></h2><p>Honestly, it looks like Jennifer Aniston hasn't aged a day since her time on&nbsp;Friends. It would be understandable if Jen looked a little haggard after her harrowing divorce from Brad Pitt in 2005, or even following her split from ex-hubby Justin Theroux in 2017. But instead, Jen has had a glow-up after every breakup. Though she turned 51 in early 2020, the timeless actress continues to impress with her lack of aging. Fans can't wait to see what she'll do next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston's Career And All The Little Things We Just Learned</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl8Buw8eoZJ2nnql6rbvOpGStoJWev26txp5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-runs-mexico-cartel-now.html><span>←</span><span>Who runs Mexico cartel now?</span></a>
