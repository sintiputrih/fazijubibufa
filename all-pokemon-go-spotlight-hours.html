The Spotlight Hour event has a new Pokémon in the hourly timeslot, and it’s available to everyone. After the hour event is over, spawns return to normal.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>August is a great time to get out and GO!</p><p>Pokémon GO Fest is taking place around the world, with adventures for all Trainers to join even if they can’t attend an in-person event!<a href=#>#PokemonGOFest2023</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EQsFtdX8P7</a></p>— Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp) <a href=#>July 28, 2023</a></figure><h2 id=1-all-july-2023-pok%C3%A9mon-go-spotlight-hour-events>Every Spotlight Hour Event in Pokemon Go for August 2023</h2><p data-injection=true>The new Pokémon appearing in Pokemon Go’s Spotlight Hour events are going to be Vulpix, Paras, Stufful, Venonat, and Tentacool.</p><p>Here are the entire Spotlight Hour dates, times, rewards, and the Pokémon available during the hour.</p><ul data-injection=true><li><strong>August 1:</strong> Vulpix will be the featured Spotlight Hour Pokemon and you can earn twice as much experience for evolving Pokemon</li><li><strong>August 8:</strong> Paras will be the featured Spotlight Hour Pokemon and you can get twice as much Stardust for catching Pokemon</li><li><strong>August 15</strong>: Stufful will be the featured Spotlight Hour Pokemon and you can get twice as much XP for catching Pokemon</li><li><strong>August 22:</strong> Venonat will be the featured Spotlight Hour Pokemon and you can get twice as much Candy for catching Pokemon</li><li><strong>August 29:</strong> Tentacool will be the featured Spotlight Hour Pokemon and you can get twice as much Candy for transferring Pokemon</li></ul><p>The Pokemon appearing in Pokemon Go’s Spotlight for August 2023 feature a good blend of choices. Vulpix is a good one for Candy to evolve an Alolan Vulpix, but <strong>Stufful is likely the best Pokemon featured for August 2023</strong>. Stufful has the most PvP potential, with Bewear being an excellent Normal and Fighting-type Pokemon.</p><p>It is important to note that all Pokemon featured in this round of Spotlight have a good chance of appearing in their shiny versions. It would be a good idea for Pokemon Go players to jump onto this event if they have yet to encounter these shiny versions.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
