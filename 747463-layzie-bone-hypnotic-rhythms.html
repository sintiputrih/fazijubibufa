It is a 12-track offering that skimps out on the features. The only guest on here is TINY, who lands on "Flyer Than Ever." A majority of the album features trap beats and woozy instrumentation. Layzie does sing on it as well, but not in a good way, unfortunately.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-hypnotic-rhythms-by-layzie-bone>Listen To Hypnotic Rhythms By Layzie Bone</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Some of the best material here lands in the first quarter of the album. Songs like the "Intro" and "Year of Goats are ones to keep a closer eye on. Layzie first announced its release about a month ago on his Instagram. "Y’all ready for some new music?????
