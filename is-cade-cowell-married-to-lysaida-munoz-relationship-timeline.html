<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Is Cade Cowell Married To Lysaida Munoz | Relationship Timeline</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Cade Cowell’s future bride appears to be Lysaida Munoz. They recently celebrated their fourth anniversary, and their impassioned posts for one another have some fans wondering if they’re engaged.</strong></p><p>Both Munoz and Cowell are under the age of 20. As a result, engagement and marriage do not need to be their top priority. Certain young people, such as Cole Kramer, however, commit to their relationships from a young age. Cowell has made quite an impression on the American soccer scene.</p><p>Last year, he became the youngest MLS player to reach 100 appearances with the San Jose Earthquakes. He is, however, leaving MLS to join Liga MX. According to reports, the 20-year-old has agreed to terms with Liga MX&nbsp; Club Guadalajara. Even though Europe was interested in his abilities, Cade opted to continue his career with the Mexican club.</p><h2>Cade Cowell’s Wife: Is He Married To Lysaida Munoz?</h2><p>Cade Cowell, Chivas’ newest signing, has not married his girlfriend Lysaida Munoz. Cade and Lysaida haven’t made any social media posts that could imply they’ve married. They have been open and honest in their relationships with the public. The family would have spread the word of their wedding or engagement. However, according to Lysaida’s mother’s Facebook page, she has not revealed any such information.</p><p>Lysaida’s engagement ring was also not visible in her most recent Instagram post. The soccer player and his girlfriend are both in their early twenties. Cade posted a birthday message to his girlfriend on Instagram last year. He shared a few images of Lysaida, including one with their dog.</p><p><strong>“Happy 20th birthday to my forever love!” The image was captioned by Cowell. I appreciate everything you do for me. “I adore you.”</strong></p><p>One of the attractions of their Instagram account is their anniversary posts for each other. On December 31, Cowell issued a fourth-anniversary message.</p><p><strong>“Happy four years, Love!” he exclaimed. I adore you above all else and can’t wait to share more memories with you.”</strong></p><p>Lysaida also wrote a heartfelt message to her soccer partner. She captioned a series of photos from their four-year photoshoot, “Happy four years to the most hard-working and amazing man I know.”</p><p><strong>Your heart is made of pure gold, and I will be eternally grateful to God for bringing you into my life. You make it easy to fall in love with you. “I will always love you.”</strong></p><p>Some soccer fans may believe Cade is engaged to his longtime girlfriend. Their messages to one another are extremely lovely and personal.</p><h2>Meet Lysaida Munoz, Cade Cowell’s girlfriend</h2><p>Cade Cowell’s girlfriend, Lysaida Munoz, graduated from Ceres High. During her stay at Ceres, Lysaida was a basketball player. Lysaida averaged 8.6 points per game in 48 games played during her three years of high school basketball. She also participated in softball for the team, appearing in 39 games.</p><p>Munoz hit 221 with a.361 OBP and 9 RBI. In 2021, Lysaida led her club to the Western Athletic Conference South Division title, but they were defeated by Los Banos. Lysaida isn’t a major social media user, and her Instagram account has only a few photographs. Her posts are largely about her partner, but she has addressed her family in one of them.</p><p>Lysaida paid tribute to her mother, Charo Marquez, on Mother’s Day 2020. Lysaida stated that her mother is her idol and that she is the one person she will always adore. Munoz sent a similar tweet last year, tagging her mother. Charo Marquez has shared some family photos on her Facebook page. In one of the family postings, Charo is seen with Lysaida and three other youngsters.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/lenny-kravitz-girlfriend-gay-children-race/"}{"1":50}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>MLS player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Meet Angeline Tan Husband Sabri Yunus | Relationship Timeline</a></h3>At the beginning of her modelling career, Angeline Tan competed in several beauty contests.
