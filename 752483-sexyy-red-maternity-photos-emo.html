The St. Louis-born performer took part in various <a href=# rel>high-profile collabs</a>, toured with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Drake</a>, and more. Her fan-favorite track "SkeeYee" even landed on top of Rolling Stone's year-end list.

Nowadays, she appears to be approaching the end of her pregnancy.</p><p>She celebrated with a sweet maternity photo shoot recently, sharing the results with Instagram followers. In the photos, Sexyy Red poses in a white bandeau and a pair of distressed blue jeans, her baby bump on full display. She also shared the spotlight with <a href=# rel>the baby's father</a>, who is seen kissing her growing belly. The photos featuring her "bd" have since been deleted, though his face was censored.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Sexyy Red Felt Went Through Great Lengths To Hide Her Pregnancy While On Drake's Tour</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sexyy-red-posts-sweet-pregnancy-photos>Sexyy Red Posts Sweet Pregnancy Photos</h2></span><p>It remains unclear why she decided to remove the photos with the father of her second child, but of course, fans have a few ideas.

Needless to say, social media sleuths are bound to analyze the photos and somehow identify him.</p><p>This could put a damper on the excitement surrounding the newest member of her family, also possibly explaining a recent clip. Sexyy Red took to Twitter earlier this week to <a href=# rel>show off her emo side</a>, swapping her signature vibrant locks with a dark wig. “I wanna kill my mom, I wanna kill my baby dad, I wanna kill my grandma,” she sings, referencing the famous Woo Wop meme.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sexyy-red-shows-off-dark-hair>Sexyy Red Shows Off Dark Hair</h2></span><p>What do you think of Sexyy Red channeling her inner emo?
