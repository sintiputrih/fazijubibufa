Justin Bieber hopes dad's offensive Pride Month post is 'forgiven'</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: <a href=# rel>Justin Bieber</a> feuds with his father! After receiving unwanted negative attention from his fans as a result of his father's offensive Pride Month message that was shared on Twitter, Justin Bieber is furious with Jeremy Bieber. In response to Pride Month, Justin's 48-year-old father posted a rainbow flag meme earlier this week with the message, "Don't forget to thank a straight person this month for your existence."</p><p>Even though Jeremy later deleted his message, it was already too late because it had sparked a lot of online animosity. Although he issued an apology on Twitter, it seems like fans weren't satisfied.</p><h2 class=split>How did Justin Bieber react to his father's tweet?</h2><p>According to Daily Mail, a source close to 'Peaches' singer told that he is upset for being dragged into this "mess" but has since spoken to his father and hopes that it will pass. "Justin hasn't had many controversies lately. He is trying to lay relatively low and just be there for [wife Hailey Bieber] and their relationship and not try to be around drama. He has had plenty of that in his life," they explained. The source further added, "But unfortunately, his dad started some new drama and now Justin is involved in the mess. He is mad at his dad for doing what he did but also knows that people will be talking about something else tomorrow and this will pass."&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Jeremy and Justin are 'on the same page'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/50c08e09-b8c1-4c5e-ab99-fba39de19641.1389378636><p>The source added that after a conversation with Jeremy, he and Justin are "on the same page to not do anything stupid like this again" and are looking to move ahead. "Justin has had an up-and-down relationship with his dad for years, and this just adds to it all. Justin's dad knows he put Justin in a bad position, but Justin is looking to move on from this as quickly as it started in the first place and hopes his dad is forgiven," the insider continued. "Especially since it is so close to Father's Day and his dad's birthday. Justin wants to celebrate his dad and not be mad at his dad."&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Jeremy Bieber's apology</h2><p>Jeremy posted an apology on Wednesday, June 7, and said that he did not "intend" to hurt the internet with his posts. "Acknowledging the nuclear family is offensive? My apologies to those offended. Was not my intent. Not that my opinion matters," he tweeted.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Acknowledging the nuclear family is offensive? My apologies to those offended. Was not my intent. Not that my opinion matters.</p>— Jeremy Bieber (@JeremyBieber) <a href=#>June 7, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Who is Jeremy Bieber?</h2><p>Besides being a father to Justin, Jeremy has two other children, daughter Jazmyn, 13, and son Jaxon, 12, with his former partner, Erin Wagner, with whom he stayed for seven years, from 2007 to 2014. Four years later, in February 2018, he tied the knot with his girlfriend, Chelsey Rebelo, and together they welcomed daughter Bay, 3. Jeremy is also a stepfather to Chelsey’s daughter, Allie, 14.&nbsp;</p><p>He separated from Justin's mother, Pattie Mallette, just 10 months after she gave birth to the singer. The duo reportedly had a troubled relationship during that time. Jeremy and Pattie were actually engaged but later canceled the wedding when she found out that Jeremy allegedly cheated on her with a mutual acquaintance, as per Pattie's autobiography, 'The Only Way Is Up'. She also claimed Jeremy spent time in county jail for fighting the day Justin was born, even though no official arrest records of his time in jail at the time were found.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Jeremy was arrested due to other offenses. In 1997 he was convicted of assault and sentenced to 3 months in prison. He spent another 21 days in jail two years later for violating his probation. He was also convicted of a second probation violation at the same time. He was charged with assault again in January 2004, but the case was later dismissed.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Jeremy's previous problematic post</h2><p>Just days before the controversial rainbow flag meme tweet, Jeremy, who is supposedly a catholic, pontificated about the "need to celebrate families" amid Pride Month. "U know the reason we're all here! The things this generation glorifies are unbelievable!" he tweeted.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>We need to celebrate families. U know the reason we’re all here! The things this generation glorifies is unbelievable!</p>— Jeremy Bieber (@JeremyBieber) <a href=#>June 5, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>People on Twitter quickly lashed out at Jeremy for his hypocrisy when he himself has failed to play the role of a father to his son, Justin. One user wrote, "Yes! thanks straight man, who left your woman at the time raising your child alone. You are definitely the best person to something about family, respect and love." Another echoed, "Says the man who abandoned his child and only came back bc he became famous.. that’s how you celebrate family?" One user penned, "Ejaculating into a woman doesn’t make you a family man", while another tweeted, "You are nobody to say that when you abandoned a child, by the way you live off your son otherwise you are nobody." "Say a man that has 3 children from 3 different women. Your moral compass is a tad askew", wrote one user.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Yes! thanks straight man, who left your woman at the time raising your child alone.
